It then arcs back to the road allowance for a very short distance before turning sharply left (east). Follow the blue blazes to the Highest Point on the Bruce Trail, at 540 m above sea level. The elevation is the result of the Algonquin Arch, a southwest-tending Precambrian rise which forms the topographic spine of southwestern Ontario. Rock layers are thinner over the Arch because it was periodically exposed above sea level 450 to 415 million years ago when the sediments were being deposited in the fluctuating shallow marine environment.Today it results in both poor farming conditions and good ski hills. Continue on the trail to the east, and soon it joins the white blazes of the main trail, continuing along the top of the valley. Along this 2 km stretch some of Ontario\u2019s most impressive geological features are visible. As the glaciers retreated, continuous freeze\/thaw conditions prevailed, creating excessive quantities of groundwater. Where the hard caprock and the soft underlying shale made contact, huge blocks, under the pull of gravity, detached themselves and slid down the slippery shale surface. The result was deep, wide crevices. These crevice caves can be tens of metres wide and up to 20 metres deep, and they are renowned for their unusual microclimate and flora. Individual blocks may boast surface dimensions of up to 20 m in length, and they may be pitched forward or tilted backwards to create impressive crevices.

The trail guide makes six stops along the way to explain the formation and history of the canyon. The Barron Canyon offers an exception to the rule that Algonquin's beauty is subtle. For a brief period after the end of the last ice age the Barron River carried the entire outflow from Lake Aggasiz (the precursor of today's Great Lakes), and a spectacular 100 m deep canyon was cut by this enormous flow of water. The Canyon is the highlight of any trip to this area, but many of the surrounding lakes are beautiful, and well worth a visit on their own merits. \r\n\r\nCompared to the crowded access points along Highway 60, the Barron Canyon and the adjacent area around Achray Station at Grand Lake can seem almost deserted. The relative lack of crowds combined with beautiful- and in places stunning- scenery make this area one of the most delightful in the park. The east side of Algonquin Park is quite different in appearance to the west. While the west side is dominated by hardwood forests and thick vegetation, conifers predominate to the east and the forests have a more open feel. The rugged pine-and-granite scenery of the east side resembles regions of the Canadian shield north of the park.

A viewing platform, gate and information board mark the entry to a more sensitive area where bicycles are prohibited. On the right is a privately owned lot that was raised with stone many years ago.

This section of the trail supports a wide variety of wildflowers from May through September. \r\nThe rocky base for most of this trail is not natural but was built as a road for cottage lots, surveyed but never developed.

The area is known for its trail riding and walking and cross-country skiing and snowshoeing, which allows for an abundance of natural experiences in a green but distinctly urban setting. Collingwood has written trails development into the official plan, which makes any development in the future provide for linkage to the existing trails system.

The Bruce Trail is connected to the 'badlands' shale feature through a new trail connection known as the Badlands Trail. The Bruce Trail has been re-aligned between the new trail connection and the parking lot on Olde Baseline Road in order to widen the trail and reduce the trail’s slope.  \r\n\r\nYou can gain access to the 'badlands' viewing area from the Bruce Trail if you take the Badlands Trail. Then you can view the 'badlands' from the new accessible boardwalk. \r\n\r\nPhysical access to walk on the badlands feature is no longer available as it leads to erosion of this sensitive feature. The Badlands are only available for viewing along the accessible boardwalk. The accessible boardwalk can also be accessed from the road. There is an accessible parking space adjacent to the accessible boardwalk and a sidewalk that leads directly to the 33 car parking lot on Olde Base Line Road. \r\n\r\nThrough new interpretive and wayfinding signage, visitors can learn about the Badlands feature and navigate the trails on the property. There are also trailhead maps located on the trailhead signs at each entrance to the property. Visitors are asked to stay on all trails and the accessible boardwalk in order to preserve and protect the sensitive site. For more information, visit the CVC website. \r\n\r\nBiking and geocaching is not allowed. \r\n\r\nWhat are the Badlands? \r\n\r\n“Badlands” is a geologic term for an area of soft rock devoid of vegetation and soil cover that has become molded into a rolling landscape of rounded hills and gullies. \r\n\r\nSuch areas are rare in Ontario and in Canada and this is one of the best examples. They exhibit the reddish hue of the Queenston Shale that forms them; the iron oxide in the shale produces this colour. The narrow greenish bands that can be seen throughout the shale are due to the change of red iron oxide to green iron oxide brought on by the circulating groundwater. \r\n\r\nThe relatively soft shale is essentially clay and is easily eroded by water. This site was acquired by the Ontario Heritage Foundation in 2000 and the property is managed by the Credit Valley Conservation. \r\n\r\nInformation provided by the Ontario Heritage Trust, Credit Valley Conservation and the Bruce Trail Conservancy.

Throughout its trail system, you walk through a glacial spillway separating two isolated rock outliers from the main escarpment, pass deep crevice caves, and walk on top of 40 metre (131 foot) cliffs. Part of the trail system is formed by old roads and carriage trails. Along with stonewalls, scattered orchard trees and farmstead ruins, there are remains of a local Irish settlement that grew to 2,200 by 1850. The hike begins on the park's Carriage Trail, then connects with the main Bruce Trail and heads north. When you reach the blue blazes, continue on the Clifftop Side Trail. At each intersection, stay to your left to continue on this trail. A viewing platform further along the trail offers a grand view of the outliers, cliff face, and spillway stretching below. With file information from the Bruce Trail, for more information on this and other Bruce trails please purchase the Bruce Trail map and trail guidebook. The Bruce Trail is the oldest and longest marked hiking trail in Canada. It is 840 km long, with over 440 km of side trails. Every year more than 400,000 visits are made to the Trail as people walk, snowshoe, watch wildlife, take photographs and admire the glorious scenery of the Escarpment.The Bruce Trail was instrumental in the Escarpment being named a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve by the United Nations in 1990 - one of only twelve such reserves in all of Canada.

The presence or absence of water, and the chemistry of that water, greatly influences how Killarney's ecosystems function. The trail begins at the Proulx Marsh. This marsh is the last in a chain of wetlands which empties into George Lake. In 1997, Proulx Marsh was almost covered in water, but today most of the water is gone. Technically Proulx Marsh isn't a marsh at all but what is commonly called a beaver meadow. It is possible that in 100 years Proulx Marsh will have to be called Proulx Forest. The trail continues through a Cattail Marsh to the Cranberry Bog. A bog is a wetland in which floating mats of sedges and sphagnum moss form, the water is fairly acidic, nutrient poor, and there is an absence of inflowing water.\u00a0 But the Cranberry Bog does have a stream link to a higher wetland near Little Sheguiandah Lake and a pH of 6.1 indicating less acidic conditions. So the Cranberry Bog isn't a bog at all but is actually a fen. A fen, fed by an external slow moving water source has higher nutrient concentrations and hosts plants found in bogs plus some orchids, water lilies, and sedges. The Cranberry Bog hosts a variety of plants, aquatic insects, and waterfowl species. As you continue further along the trail you will reach A.Y. Jackson Lake. This lake is a headwater lake, located at the top of a water system. There is a stream on the far shore that provides an outlet draining into George Lake. As with many other lakes within the park, A.Y. Jackson was damaged by acidic precipitation but is slowly recovering. This picturesque lake was named after A.Y. Jackson the renowned Group of Seven artist. In the 1930's A.Y. Jackson was instrumental in gaining protection for Killarney's first tiny forest reserve which has grown into the park that we enjoy today. Like the wetland environments along this trail, everything you see as you look around is linked together. By understanding one tiny corner of the world a little bit better, we develop an appreciation for the interconnectedness of life, and the importance of simple things like water.

From Queenston Formation red shale and Lockport Formation chert beds, you'll also see the most southerly exposures of Cabot Head (grey shale) and Manitoulin (shale dolomite) formations. \r\nBefore following the trail on the opposite creek bank, cross over the railroad tracks and follow the blue side trail markers along the creek and into Battlefield Park, site of the 1813 Battle of Stoney Creek. You can visit the Gage Homestead, now a museum and climb the tower for a view of the CN Tower and Lake Ontario. \r\nThe Bruce Trail loops through red oak and white pine forest and returns for 500 metres (1640 feet) along the road. With file information from the Bruce Trail, for more information on this and other Bruce trails please purchase the Bruce Trail map and trail guidebook. The Bruce Trail is the oldest and longest marked hiking trail in Canada. It is 840 km long, with over 440 km of side trails. Every year more than 400,000 visits are made to the Trail as people walk, snowshoe, watch wildlife, take photographs and admire the glorious scenery of the Escarpment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bruce Trail was instrumental in the Escarpment being named a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve by the United Nations in 1990 - one of only twelve such reserves in all of Canada. The Bruce Trail is a member of the Ontario Trails Council through affiliation with Hike Ontario. \r\n","surface":"Grass\/natural, Rock, Gravel, Soil - Compacted","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/NC%5FEauClaire%5F1L.jpg","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/NC%5FEauClaire%5F1L.jpg"},{"id":415,"trail_name":"Devil's Rock (Mani-doo Aja-bikong) Trail","difficulty_num":1,"character":"Natural, Scenic","difficulty":1,"activities":"Hiking & Walking","nearbyamenities":"","length":"2 km flat, 3 km climb","closest_town":"Cobalt","longitude_num":-79.610023,"latitude_num":47.425371,"description":"An easy 2 km from Highway 567 or a very scenic 3 km climb from Bucke Park (705.672.2611).

Hidden among the skyscrapers, you will discover a rich variety of parks, gardens and streetscapes. \r\n\r\nSince the 1960s, most of Toronto's parks and gardens have been created through building demolition, land exchanges, street closures, lease agreements, land purchases and through the City’s development approval process for major projects. \r\n\r\nToronto parks and gardens have design features ranging from traditional to contemporary, from pastoral to urban. Cloud Gardens, Simcoe Park and Olympic Gardens are a few of the many parks noted for their unique design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther open spaces include a Victorian garden, a sculpture garden, a cloud forest in a greenhouse, a historic railway round-house park and ceremonial squares, all within the core of Canada's largest City. Many of these parks and gardens have been created over underground shopping concourses and parking lots, where a minimum of five feet of soil is provided for the healthy growth of trees. These parks provide Torontonians places to stop, look and listen are provided in these green spaces, most of which have seating, public art, water elements and nearby cafes and shopping. Even in Toronto a variety of wildlife finds habitat and refuge in these same green spaces, particularly during spring and fall when birds and some butterflies are migrating. Species seen most often throughout the year are pigeons, squirrels and raccoons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you continue your exploration, you will encounter trees, shrubs and flowers growing along sidewalks and in planters on both public and private land. In Toronto trees are invaluable assets in improving the quality of urban life by reducing air pollution, creating shade and beautifying neighbourhoods as well as providing wildlife food and habitat. Parks, gardens and streetscapes provide dramatic contrasts with surrounding historic and contemporary buildings. Note the wide variety of building materials used. Fossils may be seen in some of the building stones along this Walk. Murals, sculptures and statues located in the parks, gardens and streetscapes along this Walk are representative of the impressive collection of public art that embodies the spirit of Toronto.

The trail follows the flood plain, with much of it on a berm that protects downtown businesses. A good stone dust surface requires regular maintenance to undo the effects of flooding.

In the vicinity of French Royalist Park, the proposed trail follows an old farm lane through the deciduous upland forest and second growth woodland. This section of the trail has a distinctly historic feel to it - an atmosphere complimented by the theme of the adjacent park. The valley lands are rich with wildlife and will provide many opportunities for trail users to experience natural heritage first hand. Rabbits, chipmunks, squirrels, white-tailed deer and 18 different species of birds are listed in the biological inventory.

The trail extends over 24,000 kilometres (15,000 miles); it is now the longest recreational, multi-use trail network in the world. The idea for the trail began in 1992, shortly after the Canada 125 celebrations. Since then it has been supported by donations from individuals, corporations, foundations, and all levels of government.[3][4] \r\n\r\nTrans Canada Trail (TCT) is the name of the non-profit group that raises funds for the continued development of the trail.

The Master Plan contemplates an interconnected Town-wide system. According to community feedback received through extensive public consultation, the Town's trail system is one of the most appreciated and popular outdoor recreation services provided by the Town. As well, new trails are the single most requested new outdoor recreational facility by Richmond Hill residents. \r\nThe East Humber Trail will pass through a variety of vegetation communities and landform features typical of those found on the Oak Ridges Moraine. The lands are comprised of old fields in various stages of succession, with some extensive woody vegetation, as well as forested areas ranging from early successional to mature mixed forests. The trail will also pass through wetland\/wet meadow communities that are located within the floodplain of the East Humber River that bisects the property diagonally from the southeast to the northwest. These lands provide a diversity of habitats for many wildlife species, particularly birds, including the Black-Billed Cuckoo, Yellow-Billed Cuckoo, Ring-Necked Pheasant and Red-Breasted Nuthatch - all uncommon in the Greater Toronto Area. \r\nEast Humber Trail was awarded the 2013 PRO Award for Excellence in Design, recognizing the exceptional contribution to environmentally sensitive and sustainable design. The project has made a local and regional impact through deliberate design considerations protecting this natural landscape. \r\n"A trail very worthy of an award" - York Region Environmental Alliance \r\nThe Environmental Design Research Association selected East Humber Trail for inclusion in their 2013 'Healthy + Healing Places Exhibition' at EDRA44Providence..

The land mass features a shelf-like flat stretch of bush and apple orchards ending with the thrilling elevations of the Niagara Escarpment. The area is known for its trail riding and walking and cross-country skiing and snowshoeing, which allows for an abundance of natural experiences in a green but distinctly urban setting. Collingwood has written trails development into the official plan, which makes any development in the future provide for linkage to the existing trails system.

Although he died an American citizen on October 23, 1946, much of his childhood was spent in Toronto. As a young boy Seton wandered through the ravines of Toronto observing animals in their natural habitat; often painting and sketching these scenes. In 1897, he won a gold medal from the Ontario College of Art, and received a scholarship to the Royal Academy in London, England. Seton was recognized as the pre-eminent naturalist of the early twentieth century, and furthered this cause by forming the Woodcraft Indians in 1902. Seton's idea to teach boys about Indian lore and the wilderness was later adopted by Lord Baden-Powell who founded the Boy Scouts.

The trail extends from above the escarpment near Albion Falls, to the lower city. The trail offers beautiful views of the lower city, the Niagara Escarpment, and the Hamilton Brick Works. The Region developed the right-of-way into a pedestrian \/ bicycle trail in 1993\r\n\r\nTrail entrances above the mountain are located at Arbour Road (Albion Falls parking lot), Limeridge Road East and Mohawk Road East (just east of Mountain Brow Blvd.). The trail follows the former CN right-of-way along the escarpment, crosses over the Kenilworth Access, then continues to Wentworth Street South (near the bottom of the Wentworth Street stairs). Upon crossing Wentworth Street South, the trail continues through the lower city ending in Corktown Park located near Ferguson Avenue South and Young Street. The section of the trail from Albion Falls parking lot to Wentworth Street South has a tar and chip surface. At Wentworth Street South, the trail changes and becomes an asphalt surface. \r\n\r\nThe HCA and Grand River Conservation Authority jointly own and operate this 32-kilometre multi-use trail which runs from Ewen Road in west Hamilton through the Dundas Valley Conservation Area to Brantford. It is Canada's first fully developed, multi-use interurban trail system. It's also a part of the Trans Canada Trail network. Links to Paris and Cambridge extend the trail to 80 kilometres. \r\n\r\nHistory \r\n\r\nDuring the mid 1800's, the City of Hamilton supported the development of two railway lines to meet the city's growing transportation needs; the Great Western (east\/west) and the Hamilton & Lake Erie (north\/south). The Escarpment Rail Trail was developed on a portion of the former route of the Hamilton & Lake Erie. \r\n\r\nDuring 1835, a charter was granted to the Hamilton & Port Dover Railway (H&PD) to construct a line between the two communities. Funding was not available and the project remained inactive. In 1853, the charter was revived and the H&PD was officially incorporated. The H&PD succeeded in making the cut in the escarpment face but incurred enormous costs in scaling the Hamilton mountain. Construction of the remaining lines was postponed and the company later succumbed to financial difficulty. \r\n\r\nIn 1869, the Hamilton & Lake Erie Railway (H&LE) was established, which extended the line to Jarvis by 1873. In 1875, the H&LE amalgamed with the Hamilton & Northwestern Railway (H&NW) and extended the line to Port Dover by 1878. \r\n\r\nThe H&NW merged with the Northern Railway of Canada in 1879, and became known as the Northern and Northwestern Railway (N&NW). In 1888 the N&NW was acquired by the Grant Trunk Railway System. The Grant Trunk had previously acquired the Great Western Railway and numerous other small rail lines. The Grant Trunk went bankrupt in 1919; the Canadian Government placed it under the management of the Canadian National Railway (CN). In 1923, CN assumed control and became the largest railway in Canada. CN maintained active operations on this line for years, and after a period of abandonment, sold the right-of-way to the Region of Hamilton-Wentworth. The Region developed the right-of-way into a pedestrian\/bicycle trail in 1993. \r\n\r\nMore on Ontario Rail Trails \r\n\r\nHealth  \r\n\r\nWikipedia \r\n\r\nArticle \r\n\r\nHike the G2G \r\n\r\nOntario Bike Trails Reviews \r\n\r\nBest 15 Bike Trails in Ontario \r\n","surface":"Asphalt, Gravel, Mixed","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/SW%5FHam%5FBrant%5F2L.jpg","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/SW%5FHam%5FBrant%5F2L.jpg"},{"id":2367,"trail_name":"Huron Natural Area","difficulty_num":1,"character":" Family Friendly, Natural Protected Area, Scenic, Natural, Urban","difficulty":1,"activities":"Hiking & Walking, Cycling - Roads & Paths, ","nearbyamenities":" Accommodations, Restaurants, Benches, Washrooms, Parking, Trailhead","length":"7 km","closest_town":"Kitchener","longitude_num":-80.4845486,"latitude_num":43.3981304,"description":"Huron Natural Area is Kitchener's biggest natural space.

A number of old pits and a large boiler may still be seen on the Mica Trail on Conservation Authority property. The mine was originally worked for phosphate by Snider and Freeman of Perth in the 1870s, then it was sold to McClatchey and Hayden of Belleville who started working it for mica. \r\n\r\nIt was acquired by J.W. Trousdale, a prominent citizen of Sydenham, in 1901, and was mined steadily until 1912. At this time it was abandoned because water had seeped in from the lake.\r\n\r\nThe main shaft was over 100 feet deep, and opened out to a chamber 8 feet by 30 feet. On the property were a boarding house, trimming-shed, stable, forge, and other buildings. No power machinery was used, and hoisting from the pits was done by a horse-derrick and whims. From 1967 to 1973, the CRCA acquired the lands that now make up Gould Lake Conservation Area.

This is a rarity since most of these trees have been logged in the area and Jack Pines only thrive after forest fires. It is assumed that this stand was started after the major fire in 1910. Wild blueberries will be easy to find in the later summer and Moccasin flowers or \"Pink Lady Slipper Orchids\" grow throughout the park. Animals can be seen in the park though be cautious because Black Bears reside in the park as well. Birdwatching can be done throughout the park but the Forest Fire Trail would be a very good place to start. There is a short and long loop available to encourage all enthusiasts to visit the park and enjoy the trail.

At the Brimstone Side Trail, turn right (west) and follow this short side trail down to the bottom of the valley at Dominion Road. When you reach Dominion Road, follow the white-blazed main Trail to the right. The Dominion Road was an extension of a settlement road from the south that followed the river valley. In the 1850s an existing trail was improved. \r\nEnjoy a pleasant walk through the river valley (there is a great place for a picnic on the riverside, conveniently located near some toilets) you will reach Cataract and the Falls. Once this was the scene of a bustling industrial complex, in 1899 the station generated power over 8 km of lines and the streets of Cataract had three experimental lights!The main trail continues past the Hydro Station, crosses the Credit River and passes an access to the community of Cataract before crossing the river again and ascending through a cedar bush to the top of the valley. From here continue to follow the main Bruce Trail back to its intersection with the Trail you took from the parking lot. \r\nWith file information from the Bruce Trail, for more information on this and other Bruce trails please purchase the Bruce Trail map and trail guidebook. The Bruce Trail is the oldest and longest marked hiking trail in Canada. It is 840 km long, with over 440 km of side trails. Every year more than 400,000 visits are made to the Trail as people walk, snowshoe, watch wildlife, take photographs and admire the glorious scenery of the Escarpment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bruce Trail was instrumental in the Escarpment being named a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve by the United Nations in 1990 - one of only twelve such reserves in all of Canada.

At that time, Garrison Creek flowed in a large deep ravine with several tributaries, from north of St. Clair Avenue to Lake Ontario. \r\n\r\nThe creek had sparkling clear water and was famous for its salmon fishing. The British built Fort York at the mouth of the creek to guard against possible American attempts to invade Canada. \r\n\r\nAs the new town of York grew into Toronto, breweries were built on the creek to take advantage of the clean water. Soon, other entrepreneurs developed land beside the creek, as abattoirs, market gardens, Trinity College and residential country estates.\r\n\r\nDozens of bridges were built over the ravine. By 1880, development along the ravine had polluted the creek. Toronto officials buried the creek in an underground sewer where it flows today. Later, the city gradually filled in sections of the ravine and demolished or buried the bridges. At least two of these original bridges remain invisible but intact, buried under Harbord Street and under Crawford Street. \r\n\r\nToday, you can find evidence of the creek’s former alignment by following the Garrison Creek Discovery Walk as it meanders along curving neighbourhood streets and through a series of interconnected parks and open spaces.\r\n\r\nCommunity groups and the City of Toronto are attempting to raise awareness of the existence of the buried creek and its tributaries and to honour it as an important public amenity. Civic improvements to parks, roads, sidewalks and boulevards found along the creek’s original route are planned. As well, extensions of this walking route are planned to the north and west. \r\n\r\nEnjoy Toronto, the City in a Park!  \r\n","surface":"Asphalt","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/SWAllanPark.jpg","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/SWAllanPark.jpg"},{"id":614,"trail_name":"Glengarry Trails - Garry Fen Trail","difficulty_num":1,"character":"Natural, Scenic","difficulty":1,"activities":"Hiking & Walking, Running","nearbyamenities":"","length":"4.5 KM","closest_town":"Alexandria","longitude_num":-74.698684,"latitude_num":45.271851,"description":"This beautiful trail is an easy 3 km loop, that begins at the Lakeshore Road Parking Lot off Highway 43 near Alexandria.  \r\n\r\nThe trails features boardwalk along the side of the Fen, orchids, carnivorous plants, hardwood forest and cedar forest.

This is the Red Rock Mountain Trail, it’s here for you, and here’s what you need to know to enjoy it and protect it! \r\n\r\nWelcome to the Red Rock Mountain Trail. The Red Rock Mountain Trail (RRMT) is a foot and bike path about 7.5 km long that goes along the crests and valleys of the Red Rock Mountain. This trail provides a stellar view of Lake Superior (Nipigon Bay and Black Bay) above the town of Red Rock from a series of three viewing platforms. \r\n\r\nRed Rock Mountain Trailhead Story \r\n\r\nThe Red Rock Mountain Trail was first constructed by local volunteers in 2010-2011 with funding from the Trillium Foundation for construction and Atlantic Power provided the funding for signage. \r\n\r\nIn 2016, with funding from the Lake Super Watershed Conservancy and Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (Rural Economic Development (RED) Program) the Township of Red Rock hired a trail builder to realign any steep inclines on the Red Rock Mountain Trail. The existing trail was groomed and upgraded to a meet a trail Classification BLUE. \r\n\r\nA parking area is installed at the head of the mountain trail. A trailhead sign and new trail marker posts and directional signage are also installed. The trail now includes a south directional extension of 1.4km to an area known as Table Rock. \r\n\r\nCurrent Classification (Moderate) \r\n\r\nBLUE with minimal Black inclines \r\n\r\nManagement \r\n\r\nThe Townships of Red Rock and Nipigon oversee the Land of the Nipigon Waterways Development Association to provide long-term sustainability of the organization. The Red Rock Mountain Trail Committee is managed under the structure of the Land of the Nipigon Waterways and Township of Red Rock. The management structure oversees development and grant administration. \r\n\r\nAllowable Uses \r\n\r\nThis trail is designed for hiking and mountain biking ONLY. ATV and 4 x 4 uses are not allowed on this trail. \r\n\r\nSignage \r\n\r\nThe trail is fully signed \r\n\r\nAccess \r\n\r\nAccess to the trailhead starts at the end of Red Rock Rd No.1, off Hwy 628. \r\n\r\nLand of the Nipigon Waterways Development Association is an incorporated Not-For-Profit trail organization. Recently the Townships of Red Rock and Nipigon took over the group to provide long-term sustainability of the organization. \r\n\r\nThe Red Rock Mountain Trail Committee is managed under the structure of the Land of the Nipigon Waterways. This provides the management structure to oversee future development and grant administration. Red Rock Mountain Trail has its own subcommittee that oversees trail activities. \r\n\r\n  \r\n","surface":"Natural","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/red%20rock%20mountain.jpg","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/red%20rock%20mountain.jpg"},{"id":691,"trail_name":"G.

The HCSA has made a commitment to significantly increase the number of hours spent grooming our trails in order to make our County one of the best places to ride! \r\n\r\nGet your pass early, on-line by November 1! \r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\nAs an off-road experience snowmobiling is an inherently risky activity. The OFSC assumes every rider using an OFSC Prescribed Trail has read, understands and accepts the "Assumptions for OFSC Trail Use". \r\n\r\nInformation provided by the Haliburton County Snowmobile website. \r\n","surface":"Snow-packed, Groomed","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/coregion\/cohillsburghsnowriderstrail\/cohillsburghsnowriderstrailmasthead\/COHillsburghSnowRoamers%5F1L.jpg","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/coregion\/cohillsburghsnowriderstrail\/cohillsburghsnowriderstrailmasthead\/COHillsburghSnowRoamers%5F1L.jpg"},{"id":703,"trail_name":"Kawagama Lake Canoe Route","difficulty_num":2,"character":" Scenic, Natural, Water, Tourism Trail","difficulty":2,"activities":"Canoe or Kayak, ","nearbyamenities":" Trailhead","length":"20 km","closest_town":"Haliburton","longitude_num":-78.800949,"latitude_num":45.245079,"description":"Generally accessed from the end of Road # 8 at the Kawagama South Shore, the Kawagama Lake canoe route is a 20km paddle that commonly takes one full day to complete. \r\n\r\nDue to the number of cottages in the immediate area, campgrounds aren’t located on the shores of the lake-sleeping arrangements must be made accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe Wolfsbane Lake and Hosiery Lake campgrounds, both within a few kilometers, are usually preferred.

After the islands were transferred from the federal government to the City of Toronto in 1867, Plan D-141 divided the land into lots and allowed cottages, amusement areas and resort hotels to be built. The west side of the island, commonly known as West Point, rapidly became a resort destination for the citizens of Toronto; the first summer cottage community was found here. \r\nIn 1878, a hotel was built by John Hanlan at the north-west tip of the island and soon after the area became known as Hanlan's Point. Edward "Ned" Hanlan, probably the most famous member of the family, earned international recognition as a rower and held numerous world records. By the 1890's, three hotels and a summer recreation centre had been built. In 1894, an ambitious lakefill project by the Toronto Ferry Company added space for an amusement park that included an exciting roller-coaster called the Big Scream. A baseball stadium, built in 1909 and destroyed by fire one year later, was rebuilt to hold 10,000 spectators. Babe Ruth, a baseball legend, hit his first professional home run here. The role of Hanlan's Point as a centre of recreation declined after the 1930's when the stadium was closed and the Maple Leaf baseball team moved to a new facility at the foot of Bathurst Street. The amusement park was demolished and in 1937 Toronto Island Airport was constructed. \r\nInformation provided by the City of Toronto website. \r\n","surface":"Asphalt","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/gtregion\/gtcentreisland\/gtcentreislandmasthead\/GT%5FCentreIsland%5F1L.jpg","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/gtregion\/gtcentreisland\/gtcentreislandmasthead\/GT%5FCentreIsland%5F1L.jpg"},{"id":712,"trail_name":"Hanlon Creek Trail","difficulty_num":2,"character":" Urban Water, OTC Member, Scenic, Natural, Urban, Historic","difficulty":2,"activities":"Hiking & Walking, Running, Cross Country Skiing","nearbyamenities":" Benches, Washrooms, Parking, Trailhead","length":"3.1 km","closest_town":"Guelph","longitude_num":-80.241845,"latitude_num":43.516522,"description":"Beginning at Stone Road Mall, the Hanlon Creek Trail takes little time to part ways with the bustling shoppers.

Then take the blue-blazed Hilton Falls Side Trail on your way to the falls. Just before the falls is a large pothole. Just after the glaciers retreated, this spot was part of a watercourse that carried the glacial torrents over the Escarpment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRocks rotating in the swirling waters gradually drilled large holes in the bedrock. Next you reach the Falls. They cascade over the rock face from a height of about 10 m. The best view is from the gorge below, reached by a flight of stairs that lead to a viewing platform. Across the creek are the ruins of a mill which dates back to 1835. After viewing the falls, simply take the Conservation Authority’s clearly marked trail back to the parking lot. \r\nWith file information from the Bruce Trail, for more information on this and other Bruce trails please purchase the Bruce Trail map and trail guidebook. The Bruce Trail is the oldest and longest marked hiking trail in Canada. It is 840 km long, with over 440 km of side trails. Every year more than 400,000 visits are made to the Trail as people walk, snowshoe, watch wildlife, take photographs and admire the glorious scenery of the Escarpment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bruce Trail was instrumental in the Escarpment being named a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve by the United Nations in 1990 - one of only twelve such reserves in all of Canada.

This trail was used by First Nations people for millennia as a trade route between Lake Ontario and the Upper Great Lakes to the north. Large oak trees, remnants from the time of the Carrying Place, still stand along the drive. One hundred and fifty of these trees were inventoried and municipally proclaimed as the “Tuhbenahneequay Ancient Grove”.

Look over MacGregor Harbour where Cape Croker juts into the waters. Then, turn your head to see Sydney Bluff and Cape Dundas, and Barrier island in the distance. The shoreline from Sydney Bay to MacGregor Harbour spreads in front of you. On many Bruce Trail walks, hikers hope the rush of the breeze through the trees means they're near the water. On this trail, although it never reaches the shoreline, you hear the waves lapping the beaches . . . they seem to rise up towards you. Some of the outcrops are large rocky areas where you can walk to a few different lookout points in one large open section. On others, you actually see the space in between a rock you're standing on, and the actual escarpment edge. Even while in the forest you see the bluffs through the trees and the wide expanse of the open water directly in front of you. As you round the loop, you'll see the beginning part of Colpoys Bay and the next entrance harbour of the neighbouring bay. You also see Hay Island slowly inch forward as you move around the bluff, and then White Cloud and Griffiths Island in the distance, as you walk above Colpoys Bay. With file information from the Bruce Trail, for more information on this and other Bruce trails please purchase the Bruce Trail map and trail guidebook. The Bruce Trail is the oldest and longest marked hiking trail in Canada. It is 840 km long, with over 440 km of side trails. Every year more than 400,000 visits are made to the Trail as people walk, snowshoe, watch wildlife, take photographs and admire the glorious scenery of the Escarpment.The Bruce Trail was instrumental in the Escarpment being named a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve by the United Nations in 1990 - one of only twelve such reserves in all of Canada. The Bruce Trail is a member of the Ontario Trails Council through affiliation with Hike Ontario.

By the 1850s, Lambton Mills was a thriving community. W. P. Howland, who was a Father of Confederation, owned, with his brothers, all the Cooper enterprises and had built the Lambton House Hotel on the east side of the river. This hotel was a social centre for the area and a stagecoach stop along the Dundas Highway. It has now been restored and was designated a National Historic Site in 1997.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTEIAIAGON AND BABY POINT The plateau at the top of the shale and limestone cliff was home to First Peoples for thousands of years. Humbercrest Boulevard traces the path of the ancient Carrying Place Trail that existed along the eastern side of the plateau. During the late 1600s, a fortified Iroquois village, called Teiaiagon, was located there. In 1720, the French established a fort on the plateau to trade in furs with the First Nations. In 1820, the Honourable Jacques Bâby acquired 200 acres of land on the east bank of the Humber River including this plateau. Since then, the area has become known as Baby Point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUMBER, A CANADIAN HERITAGE RIVER The Humber, the largest river system in the Toronto region, was designated a Canadian Heritage River in 1999. A plaque commemorating this event is located in Brûlé Park. The ancient Toronto Carrying Place Trail follows the high ground east of the river. The river valley is a natural corridor for Toronto birds and other wildlife. Look for signs of beaver activity along the river. Also, watch for the many wildflowers blooming in the valley from spring to fall. More than 25 fish species inhabit this part of the river. These include pike, bass, perch, trout and salmon. In the fall, look for salmon leaping over the notched weirs as they swim upriver to spawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FISHER MILL AND HURRICANE HAZEL Thomas Fisher built a gristmill here in the 1830s. You can still see traces of the ruins among the trees bordering the picnic area. Hurricane Hazel struck southern Ontario on October 15, 1954 sending a wall of water 7 metres high down this river valley overpowering Toronto's watershed. Look for a nearby plaque honouring five volunteer firemen who drowned in a rescue attempt during the flood. \r\n","surface":"Asphalt","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/Heritage%5F1L.jpg","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/Heritage%5F1L.jpg"},{"id":950,"trail_name":"Lancaster - Waterfront Trail","difficulty_num":3,"character":"Scenic","difficulty":3,"activities":"Hiking & Walking, Cycling - Roads & Paths","nearbyamenities":"","length":"20.6 km","closest_town":"Lancaster","longitude_num":-74.496188,"latitude_num":45.138068,"description":"The Waterfront Trail runs on scenic County Rd 2 through most of the Township of South Glengarry.

The portages are about 11 kms in length and are long and tough and move through very muddy areas. At the beginning of the portages there is a historical plaque. The route was used thousands of years ago by most First Nation groups in Ontario at the time of European contact. \r\n\r\nYou should expect that a few things have changed since the days of the voyageurs. For one, sections of the portages are routed away from their original location, because some land has been taken over by industries (e.g. the quarry and the safety perimeter around a chemical factory). In other places, the water level has changed and drowned the original path. And, there is a section of the LaVase River that the voyageurs had to portage since they could not maneuver the large boats around the tight bends of the river - while you can paddle and enjoy the swifts and riffles. \r\n\r\nLast not least, urbanization has brought railways, roads and houses to the southern end of the route. But, the upper sections of the route are still in a natural state, and if you are willing to put up with the chore of portaging, you can retrace the steps of Canada's explorers on this crucial link of the Canadian fur trade routes. \r\n\r\nThere has been little use of the portages over the last decades, maybe because they are a bit of a chore, because urbanization encroached in the lower sections and, with people having cars to go further, paddlers went elsewhere for their weekend trips.

The lighthouse is 200 years old and is one of the three oldest on the Great Lakes. A pioneer family named Cartier settled at the mouth of the Thames River in the early 1800’s and built the first lighthouse. The original frame structure was destroyed by fire during the War of 1812. In 1818, the present structure was built and extended in height to its present level after Confederation. The original Cartier family looked after the lighthouse for about 130 years until William "Dick" Cartier died in 1950. The Lower Thames Valley Conservation Authority obtained the lighthouse in 1973 and has since moved the structure and rebuilt it stone by stone. \r\n\r\nThe LTVCA has acquired land in the watershed (see watershed map) to protect environmentally sensitive lands, wetlands, culturally unique features such as the Ska-Nah-Doht Iroquoian Village and significant biological, ecological, historical and scenic qualities from development. Over 1,000 acres of conservation land have been preserved at 20 sites for public use across the LTVCA watershed. It is estimated that well over 1,000,000 people have made use of all the conservation lands over the years.

To find the Irvine Gorge access, return to the main trail, and walk along the gorge until you come to a staircase. Closed during the winter, this staircase leads to the bottom of the Irvine Creek gorge. Flows are typically very low here during the summer, and it is quite easy to walk along the gorge bottom (maximum water depth about 5-15cm). There are some very small caves that can be explored on the far side of this gorge. You can access the main gorge by walking downstream from this location.

Native people frequently visited the area and named the creek Etobicoke for "place where the wild alders grow". Augustus Jones, a crown-appointed surveyor, Anglicized the name to Black Alders Creek around 1800. The park was created in 1954 after the high flood waters caused by Hurricane Hazel devastated a number of low-lying properties. The disaster prompted provincial and municipal governments to administer flood protection. \r\nDue to their hazardous location on the flood plain, 164 homes were acquired and removed. Marie Curtis was first elected as Reeve of the Village of Long Branch in 1953, a position she held until 1962. She was a member of the first Metro Council which began January 12, 1954, and later played an instrumental role in the formation of a regional parkland system in Toronto.

From the parking area, head north, west and then north again along the farm lanes on the west side of McCarston’s Lake. Here you are crossing the Orangeville Moraine. \r\n\r\nWhen climate conditions became less severe, glaciers would often stagnate, and sand and gravel from the melting ice was deposited at the nose of the glacier in knobby ridges called moraines. In the Mono area are two very extensive moraines: the Orangeville Moraine to the west and the Singhampton-Gibraltar Moraine to the east. \r\n\r\nThese moraines run roughly north-south along the line of the Niagara Escarpment, and would have formed during times when the glacier was stalled in that area. The McCarston’s Lake Side Trail circles around the west and north sides of the lake. Past the intersection with the Lookout Side Trail, it heads south along the shoreline and then swings east to follow the Escarpment edge. You will soon come across “Jacob’s Ladder”, which allows you to descend the Escarpment a short distance, when you have finished at Jacob’s Ladder, return to the main trail and turn left to continue along the 2nd Line road allowance to your car. \r\n\r\nWith file information from the Bruce Trail, for more information on this and other Bruce trails please purchase the Bruce Trail map and trail guidebook. The Bruce Trail is the oldest and longest marked hiking trail in Canada. It is 840 km long, with over 440 km of side trails. Every year more than 400,000 visits are made to the Trail as people walk, snowshoe, watch wildlife, take photographs and admire the glorious scenery of the Escarpment. The Bruce Trail was instrumental in the Escarpment being named a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve by the United Nations in 1990 - one of only twelve such reserves in all of Canada. The Bruce Trail is a member of the Ontario Trails Council through affiliation with Hike Ontario. \r\n","surface":"Soil - Compacted","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/00041209northcentral.jpg","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/00041209northcentral.jpg"},{"id":1096,"trail_name":"McCormack Trail","difficulty_num":1,"character":"Natural, Scenic","difficulty":1,"activities":"Hiking & Walking","nearbyamenities":"","length":"2.7 km","closest_town":"Ancaster","longitude_num":-79.997892,"latitude_num":43.254692,"description":"This trail is a gentle footpath through the trees, featuring fields, streams and a scenic view of Hamilton. \r\n","surface":"Soil - Compacted","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/COPenetaguishene%5F2L.jpg","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/COPenetaguishene%5F2L.jpg"},{"id":2232,"trail_name":"G2G Rail Trail","difficulty_num":1,"character":" OTC Member, Scenic, Rail Trail, Flat with minimal incline, Town","difficulty":1,"activities":"Hiking, Walking, Cycling, Winter (Fat) Biking, Cross Country Ski, Snowshoe, Equestrian, ","nearbyamenities":" Accommodations, Bird Watching, Restaurants, Benches, Washrooms, Parking, Trailhead, Arboretum","length":"127 km","closest_town":"Guelph","longitude_num":-80.318243,"latitude_num":43.567214,"description":"The Guelph to Goderich\/Goderich to Guelph(G2G) rail trail is located in Southwestern Ontario and runs 127km in length. \r\n\r\nGoderich to Guelph Rail Trail Inc. is a non-profit, charitable community organization that strives to enrich the quality of life for all people and the sustainable development of communities by advancing and promoting the development, preservation, and enjoyment of diverse, high-quality trails and greenways. \r\n\r\nGoderich to Guelph Rail Trail Inc. is a non-profit, charitable community organization developing a rail trail across southwestern Ontario. \r\n\r\nFacebook Page \r\n\r\nWebsite \r\n\r\nMap \r\n\r\nDonate \r\n\r\nFor more information on trails or to view a trail video by activity please go to the OTC Youtube Channel \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOntario Trails do not own or manage any trails.

The legacy of the late Colonel the Honourable Michael Starr will live on with the opening of the Michael Starr Trail. The official opening of the trail took place on October 11, 2001, just a short distance from the former home of the Starr family. The construction of the trail recognizes Colonel Starr's many contributions to the City of Oshawa, and Canada. Through a municipal\/provincial partnership, the trail was built on the CN spur line the City acquired from the railway. The first phase of the development was between Lviv Boulevard and Athol Street, but it will eventually be extended north to Taunton Road. The trail will be a major recreational feature within the City and will provide a linear green corridor through some of the older residential areas, including the area where Michael Starr lived and raised his family. The trail provides people with the opportunity to experience passive recreational opportunities, wildlife habitat and green space. It runs through a large portion of the City's urban core and features an asphalt path, tree and shrub plantings, ground covers, benches and landscape entrance features. Phase two, between Connaught Park and Queen Elizabeth School, is scheduled to be completed in 2002. A cycling\/pedestrian route will be established on-street between the two sections of the trail to create links to the downtown area and the trail systems on the Oshawa and Harmony Creeks.

Milne Dam Conservation Park was named after Peter and Alexander Milne who operated a mill, located near the present dam structure, in the 1820’s. By 1845, the business had expanded to include a general store, fueling and wool mill and ashery. In 1911, Archie Milne, grandson of Peter Milne, built the first concrete and steel arc dam in Canada. \r\n\r\nThe Town of Markham sprang from the advent of the mill and dam. In the 1950’s, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority acquired the property as the Milne Park Conservation Area. Wonderful opportunities for bird watching exist in this area as the significant wetlands, forests and open space provide a stopoff for migratory birds. Blue Jays, chickadees, woodpeckers, Blue Herons and a nesting pair of Baltimore Orioles, Milne Dam Conservation Park is Markham's largest park of 123 hectare or 305 acre with the Rouge River flowing in the middle and surrounded with a lush forest on the southern and eastern edges. \r\n\r\nIt is located on the east side of McCowan Road, just south of Highway 7.

"Morningside" usually refers to the sunrise side of an area. The valley of the Highland Creek was at one point inhabited. A housing shortage after World War II resulted in many small cottages being converted into year-round residences, especially in the "Willows" area (immediately north-east of Lawrence Avenue and Orton Park Road) and elsewhere in the Highland Creek Valley below Highway 401. Large numbers of settlers greatly intensified problems in an area not well suited for year-round habitation. Contaminated wells, evictions, and home demolition were contentious issues in the post-war period. \r\nThe steep slopes and flat floodplain of the creek valley further complicated living conditions in the area as residents and their cottages were regularly threatened by flash flooding. The severe damage from Hurricane Hazel in 1954 strengthened the demand for public ownership of floodplain land to prevent further development.

Be sure to bring binoculars to view: Great Blue Herons, Kingfishers, American Coots, Gallinules, Black Terns and the occasional Osprey. This canoe route follows a section of Samuel de Champlain\u2019s 1615 expedition into the interior of Canada. Canoe up the northwestern end of Muskrat Lake past the permanent summer camp. Muskrat Lake, 14 km long, lies in a pre-glacial valley that occupies an old fault line. The western shore of this long, narrow lake abuts a clay plain while, to the east, an escarpment of Precambrian rock rises more than 60m. Enter the Muskrat River at the end of the Lake. Pass under the bridge on Hwy 17 and the railway bridge where Barn Swallows nest and race between the steel girders. For those seeking a shorter trip, put in the canoe at the launch beside the bridge just off Hwy 17 and continue upstream. Close by the river flows through a Silver Maple swamp where there is a small stand of Ostrich Ferns along the left (southern) shoreline. Kingfishers, Great Blue Herons and the occasional Osprey survey the shoreline of the river which are lined with Willows and Silver Maple trees. Follow the river to Mud Lake. Mud Lake is a great place to view American Coots, Gallinules, Cormorants and rare Black Terns which frequent the area in summer. For the half-day trip head back the way you came. For the longer trip cross the 3 km wide lake and rejoin the Muskrat River. Paddle down stream until you run out of steam.

First Peoples used these ravines as early as 4000 years ago. They camped, hunted and traveled in these areas. During the early to mid 1800s, logging was common in these ravines. \r\n\r\nToday, Toronto's municipal by-laws protect these ravines and the City is restoring much of the vegetation. Burke Brook once flowed naturally through these ravines. Walking beside the brook today, you’ll be amazed at the number of ways people have modified the water course, including straightening, ditching, tunneling and burying, in order to accommodate excess storm sewer water. In sharp contrast to these modifications, you’ll find the eastern-most section of the brook, in Sherwood Park Ravine, in a nearly untouched natural state. Toronto is trying to return the brook to as natural a state as possible.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER MUIR MEMORIAL GARDENS Stroll among the herbs and flowers that bloom in this magnificent formal multilevel garden that was planted in the 1950s. The gardens act as a superb public gateway into the peaceful ravine system. Alexander Muir wrote the patriotic song, “The Maple Leaf Forever”, in 1867. \r\n\r\nSHERWOOD PARK Explore Sherwood Park Ravine, one of the largest remaining protected natural areas in the city. This Toronto park contains a small remnant of the vast Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Forest, which once covered this region. Species you can see include white pine, hemlock, beech, oak and sugar maple.

Have you wondered what old growth forest is, how old it is? Or what\u2019s the difference between old growth and ancient forest? The answers to these and many other questions await you. The history of the Temagami area, in terms of both its natural and cultural heritages, is diverse and extensive. Aboriginal inhabitants, the Teme-Augama Anishnabai, have occupied this area, their homeland (n'Daki Menan), for at least 6,000 years. Temagami Island lies within n'Daki Menan, the homeland of the Teme-Augama Anishnabai, which encompasses almost 4,000 square miles. Archaeological investigations have documented human habitation in the Temagami area as early as 1,000 B.C., and it is likely that these were ancestors of the tribe that presently occupies the area. Historically, the Teme-Augama Anishnabai were a hunter-gatherer society that moved with the seasons and with the availability of various resources. Within their homeland, certain areas had special significance. Temagami Island has two such areas of significance. As you hike the old-growth trail, you\u2019ll follow the portage to Dalton Lake for the first 50 meters or so. The aluminum portage sign here was posted just after World War II.

The land at what is now the junction of Britannia and Ninth line was home to Irish immigrants who cleared and farmed the area and provided much of the manpower for the construction of the Welland Canal. \r\n\r\n What is now the Osprey Marsh was an area of the original pioneer community which was unsuitable for agriculture due to its relatively low-lying marsh and bog characteristics. Today, it is part of the Mississauga water management system. This organization of natural creeks, ponds and marshes is joined with man-made waterways and catchments to facilitate a comprehensive network of water management that provides much needed recreational and green space to an ever growing urban \/ suburban environment. It has been designed to manage and relieve water levels in the advent of severe weather. \r\n\r\n  The wide paved path around the circumference of the ponds is perfect for walking and biking and easily accepts wheelchairs. As well, there are narrow dirt footpaths through the middle “islands” that separate the ponds and lead to the marsh at the eastern portion of the area that skirts the Lisgar Meadow Brook Trail. \r\n\r\n  The Osprey marsh is home to a wide diversity of plant and animal life. A variety of birds including ducks, Canada geese and blue herons are sustained by abundant sources of food. There are a number of interpretive plaques along the trail that explain the origins, uses and animal inhabitants of the marsh area. \r\n\r\n  While you're in the area you may want to spend a few minutes visiting St. Peter's Catholic Church, directly opposite the marsh on the west side of Ninth Line. The church, built in the mid 19th century was the place of worship for the predominantly Irish catholic settlers who farmed the area. The small cemetery adjoining the church property holds the remains of many of these pioneers. \r\n\r\n  Wheelchair access is through Johnny Bower Park on Parkgate Drive.

Although no move was made in 1966 towards acquisition of the wetland, the area was considered to be of value for conservation purposes.\r\n\r\nThe property has been designated as public recreation area since 1969 by Ernestown Township Council to preclude development. As a public recreation area, Parrott's Bay has been a source of passive enjoyment for canoeists, anglers, and naturalists.

Accessing the Crowe Bridge Conservation Area requires good mobility on rocky footing as you need to pull your boat up onto relatively rocky shore south of the falls and walk up in the shallow water or along the exposed rock - a particularly fun adventure in the summer when water shoes and bathing suits are on already. \r\n\r\nDistance: Approx. 5km round trip, but as short or as long as you wish! (You can put in at Lock 16\/17 if you’d like a slightly longer paddle and more lockage). \r\n\r\nPortages: None \r\n\r\nLaunch point: At Lock 15 you can turn left onto Canal Rd off of 11th Line W and immediately on your right you’ll see an access point - a little gravel and pavement ramp. You can drop your boat and gear here and then bring your car up to the Lock parking lot. As this puts you at the top side of the locks you get to lock through which is what I recommend if you are kayaking and\/or are concerned about carrying your canoe down the stairs. If you want to skip the lock you can portage your vessel down the stairs.  This is easier to do in a canoe though as there is a foot and a half drop from the canal down and the natural shoreline beyond is fairly rocky. This still requires some agility and strength to put your vessel in the water. \r\n\r\nShuttle Info: Round trip – no shuttle required. \r\n\r\nDirections: 10 minutes north of Campbellford. Map Link. \r\n\r\nBest Time to Go: Since the easiest access point for this route is from the top of Lock 15, May to October is the best time of year to take this route so you can take full advantage of the Locks while the Waterway is open.

The side trail is named after Ray Lowes, the Founder of the Bruce Trail. Ray’s concern for conservation of the Niagara Escarpment in 1960 lead him to the idea of providing a public footpath on Escarpment so that people would explore it and see the need to conserve it. From his original idea, the Bruce Trail Association and its member Clubs now develop and manage more than 1,200 kilometres of main Trail and side trails, and are active in preserving and stewarding thousands of hectares of land along the Escarpment. \r\n\r\nWith file information from the Bruce Trail, for more information on this and other Bruce trails please purchase the Bruce Trail map and trail guidebook. The Bruce Trail is the oldest and longest marked hiking trail in Canada. It is 840 km long, with over 440 km of side trails. Every year more than 400,000 visits are made to the Trail as people walk, snowshoe, watch wildlife, take photographs and admire the glorious scenery of the Escarpment.\r\n\r\nThe Bruce Trail was instrumental in the Escarpment being named a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve by the United Nations in 1990 - one of only twelve such reserves in all of Canada.

John Scarlett, a prominent buinessman in the Westmount and Humbermount area, operated a distillery and number of mills. In 1857, local businessman Rowland Burr announced a prop=sal to build a canal four metres deep and thirty-seven metres wide, with sixty-four double locks, to link Lake Ontario and Georgian Bay through Lake Simcoe. The canal route followed the Humber River Valley and actually cut through Raymore Park. Costs were estimated to exceed $35 million. \r\nAlthough the project was later advanced by various groups such as the Toronto and Georgian Bay Canal Company and the Georgian Bay Ship Canal and Power Aqueduct Company, it was never completed. In 1995, a new footbridge was constructed with support from the Province of Ontario, representing a substantial step towards the completion of the Humber Trail and greenway system. The Raymore Bridge helped realize Toronto's goal for a network of regional trails extending through the valleylands and along the waterfront, and further the MTRCA's ambitious plan for an uninterrupted trail through the Humber River watershed from Lake Ontario north to the Oak Ridges Moraine. \r\n  \r\n","surface":"Asphalt","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/gtregion\/gtafcoventrynaturetrail\/gtafcoventrynaturetrailmasthead\/GTAFCoventryNatureTrail%5F1L.jpg","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/gtregion\/gtafcoventrynaturetrail\/gtafcoventrynaturetrailmasthead\/GTAFCoventryNatureTrail%5F1L.jpg"},{"id":1447,"trail_name":"Red Hill Valley Recreational Trail","difficulty_num":2,"character":"Urban","difficulty":2,"activities":"Hiking & Walking, Cycling - Off-Road","nearbyamenities":"","length":"10.5 km","closest_town":"Hamilton","longitude_num":-79.765549,"latitude_num":43.258331,"description":"Beginning at the top of the Niagara Escarpment (Mud Street, adjacent to Kings Forest Park), the Red Hill Valley Recreational Trail traverses the escarpment and runs northeast through the Red Hill Valley to its end at Brampton Street, south of the Queen Elizabeth Highway and Lake Ontario.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trail is approximately 10.5 kilometres long by 3 metres wide, and includes bridge crossings of the Red Hill Creek, entrances from streets and\/or parking lots , and a 1.1 kilometre long barrier-free section (with a tar and chip surface) accessible from Greenhill Bowl through Kings Forest Golf Course. \r\nMost of the trail is not wheelchair accessible due to steep grades. \r\n","surface":"Asphalt, Grass\/natural, Gravel, Soil - Compacted, Boardwalk, Mix","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/WaterfrontTrail%5FMasthead.jpg","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/WaterfrontTrail%5FMasthead.jpg"},{"id":1448,"trail_name":"Red Lake Millennium Trail","difficulty_num":2,"character":"Natural","difficulty":2,"activities":"Hiking & Walking, Snowshoeing & Backcountry, ATVing","nearbyamenities":"","length":"3.4 km","closest_town":"Red Lake","longitude_num":-93.802085,"latitude_num":51.02072,"description":"This multi-purpose trail provides opportunities for walking, biking and use of all-terrain vehicles. \r\n\r\nWildlife observation includes a variety of birds, beavers and other small animals. \r\n\r\nDirections: Trail begins across from Hospital Hill or at the end of Young Street. \r\n\r\nInformation provided by the Red Lake website.\r\n  \r\n","surface":"Soil - Compacted","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/nwregion\/nwredlakemillenniumtrail\/nwredlakemillenniumtrail-masthead\/NWRedLakeMillenniumTrail%2DL1.jpg","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/nwregion\/nwredlakemillenniumtrail\/nwredlakemillenniumtrail-masthead\/NWRedLakeMillenniumTrail%2DL1.jpg"},{"id":2302,"trail_name":"Nicholsons Locks & Vicinity Tour","difficulty_num":2,"character":" Scenic, Natural, Historic, Water, Conservation Trail","difficulty":2,"activities":"Hiking & Walking","nearbyamenities":" Benches, Washrooms, Parking, Trailhead","length":"3.5 km","closest_town":"Andrewsville","longitude_num":-75.8316568,"latitude_num":44.9515711,"description":"This on and off road hike in the area of Upper and Lower Nicholsons Locks passes a variety of interesting natural and historic features including an historic bridge that is swung by hand, an osprey nest, a ghost town, and a pioneer cemetery. \r\n\r\nParking, washrooms and picnic facilities are available in season while the Rideau Canal Waterway is open.

Canoe and walk-in campsites provide access to an unrivaled remote backcountry experience. Wildlife viewing is excellent in Restoule as the park boasts a healthy population of large and small wildlife. Coyote, wolf, bear, otter, pine martin, moose and deer are just some of the fauna inhabiting the park and area. More than 90 species of birds (including the rare and endangered peregrine falcon) are known to inhabit the park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHighlights include a heron rookery, active waterfowl nesting and a large variety of birds of prey.

The geology of the park and area is complex and fascinating. Geologically, the park is located along a feature known as the Nipising-Ottawa Valley Rift. \r\n\r\nSheer rock walls and jagged peaks contrast with secluded lakes, ponds and streams. The most obvious feature of the rift in the park is the 60-metre cliff at the east end of Stormy Lake. You can visit the top of the cliff and enjoy the incredible view on the Fire Tower Trail.

The  Mine, located in Concession 10, Lot 7, is situated between Blue Lake and Gould Lake. A number of old pits and a large boiler may still be seen on the Mica Trail on Conservation Authority property. \r\n\r\nThe mine was originally worked for phosphate by Snider and Freeman of Perth in the 1870s, then it was sold to McClatchey and Hayden of Belleville who started working it for mica.\r\n\r\nIt was acquired by J.W. Trousdale, a prominent citizen of Sydenham, in 1901, and was mined steadily until 1912. At this time it was abandoned because water had seeped in from the lake. The main shaft was over 100 feet deep, and opened out to a chamber 8 feet by 30 feet. \r\n\r\nOn the property were a boarding house, trimming-shed, stable, forge, and other buildings. No power machinery was used, and hoisting from the pits was done by a horse-derrick and whims. From 1967 to 1973, the CRCA acquired the lands that now make up Gould Lake Conservation Area. Much of the land was purchased from Loughborough Township. Several private landowners sold to the CRCA including as well, including the Dickey, Anglin, Seymour, and the Sands families.  \r\n\r\nAdmission varies: $3 for children 12 and under, $5.50 for adults, max $14 per car.

This 126 hectare (312 acre) site protects a portion of the Niagara Escarpment, the Rockway Falls, and the diverse flora and fauna of the Carolinian Forest. The Bruce Trail traverses the southern section of this area and is considered an ideal spot for hiking. Two main waterfalls exist along this portion of the 15 mile creek. \r\nThe larger of the two plunges from a height of 19.5 (63 ft) metres while the smaller from a height of 12.2 metres. The watercourse continues to surge over a series of rapids. Some interesting flora can be witnessed at this location, for example, Jack-in-the-Pulpit, Witch Hazel, and Sycamore to name a few. The existence of a salt spring brings some historical significance to the area as it is thought to have been used as far back as 1792, containing some of the best quality and quantity of salt in the province. Site facilities include limited parking off 9 th Ave. on escarpment tablelands. \r\nDirections: From the QEW take the QEW to Seventh Street Louth. Travel south along Seventh Street Louth to Hwy 81. Turn right on Highway 81 Left onto Ninth Street. Entrance and parking for Conservation Area on left hand side.

Encircled by tall maples, the modest white clapboard house and its garden of flowers and lawn sit comfortably behind a low dry-stone wall.\r\n\r\nRolling fields, some dotted with grazing cattle, surround the house, and a large barn dominates the farmyard. Begin your hike by following the blue blazes of the Bennett Heritage Trail as it heads east. Just beyond the barn is a pond created by a dam over Snow’s Creek, a tributary of Silver Creek.\r\n\r\nWith cedar and weeping willows lining its banks and a resident family of swans, it is an idyllic spot and a wonderful place for children to play. The Trail takes you down a tree-shaded country lane that used to be the rear entrance to the property. Just before reaching the 8th Line, turn right on the Maureen Smith Side Trail. This section honours Maureen, a long-time volunteer who continues to serve in a variety of roles with the Toronto Bruce Trail Club. When you reach the white blazes of the main Bruce Trail, turn right (west).\r\n\r\nThe Trail passes along the edge of fields and through a swampy area. Then the mood of the landscape changes; you enter more mature woods where tall graceful trees form a high canopy overhead. As you approach Trafalgar Road where the white blazes turn left, keep to the right on the blue-blazed Bennett Heritage Trail. It goes up a short hill and parallels the old main driveway into the farm and back to your car. \r\n\r\nWith file information from the Bruce Trail, for more information on this and other Bruce trails please purchase the Bruce Trail map and trail guidebook. The Bruce Trail is the oldest and longest marked hiking trail in Canada. It is 840 km long, with over 440 km of side trails. Every year more than 400,000 visits are made to the Trail as people walk, snowshoe, watch wildlife, take photographs and admire the glorious scenery of the Escarpment.\r\n\r\nThe Bruce Trail was instrumental in the Escarpment being named a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve by the United Nations in 1990 - one of only twelve such reserves in all of Canada.

The Humber Trail, or the Toronto Carrying Place, actually followed the east bank of the river along what is now Riverside Drive. After Yonge Street was constructed in 1796, the Humber River declined as a major route inland because overland travel aided by the horse, and later rail, was not restricted by low water levels or the availability of boats. \r\nSouth Humber Park is located on the west bank of the river across from the Humber Marshes, just north of the Humber Sewage Treatment Plant. The former Metropolitan Toronto purchased the former Humber Valley Golf Course in the early 1950's, but did not dedicate the remaining land as open space until 1955. One year earlier, the Humber Valley was severely damaged by Hurricane Hazel.

At the head of the valley is the magnificent Webster’s Falls, at 24 m (78 feet) in height, a popular spot on a hot summer’s day. After climbing the 123-step metal staircase to the top of the Escarpment, the Trail crosses Spencer Creek by a cobblestone bridge and turns right to follow the rim of the gorge. Passing the grave site of the Webster family, the white blazes of the main Trail continue along the valley side and up a staircase to a magnificent view over the y-shaped valley, and shortly after, the parking lot at Tews Falls. \r\nWith file information from the Bruce Trail, for more information on this and other Bruce trails please purchase the Bruce Trail map and trail guidebook.

Look out for Oak-Hickory Woodland, Oak Savannah, Red Cedar Savannah, and old-field thicket. From late July to early September, all the open areas are masterfully coloured with the yellow of gray-headed coneflower, the purple of nodding wild onion and clusters of the white of whorled milkweed. \r\n\r\nChinquapin oaks are scattered throughout the unique alvar habitat and can often be well over 100 years old. In the open savannahs, visitors can find the provincially rare Hop Tree as well as Blue Ash. \r\n\r\nOf special note is the local abundance of Downy Wood Mint, a plant that in Canada is confined to Pelee Island. Stone Road Alvar is also prime habitat for the endangered Blue Racer snake.

The building of the route was overseen by Colonel Thomas Talbot. It was originally a corduroy road which eventually became Highway 3 and several modern county and regional roadways. Its original intent was to provide a continuous land route for settlers and military personnel between the Niagara region and Amherstburg, aiding in the development of the Talbot Settlement. \r\n\r\nThe route begins in Windsor and travels northeast through Leamington, Wheatley, Blenheim and St. Thomas. East of Aylmer, it leaves Highway 3 and follows County Road 38 (Heritage Line) proceeding through the village ofStraffordville. It continues to Courtland, where it rejoins Highway 3. The route proceeds east along Highway 3 through Delhi,Simcoe, Jarvis and Cayuga. At Dunnville, the route splits from Highway 3 and follows County Road 3 (Lakeshore Road) through the tiny communities of Stromness, Lowbanks, Long Beach and Camelot Beach, before rejoining Highway 3 near Wainfleet. It proceeds east along Highway 3, terminating at the Niagara River in Fort Erie. \r\n\r\nThe actual 19th century settlement road began in Amherstburg and ended in Canborough, north of Dunnville, where existing settlement roads provided a route to Fort Erie and Niagara Falls. \r\n\r\nInformation provided by the Regional Municipality of Niagara and Wikipedia websites. \r\n\r\nPlease visit Cycle Ontario for more information on the Talbot Trail \r\n","surface":"Gravel","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/ni-region\/nitalbottrail\/nitalbottrailmasthead\/NI%5FTalbottrail%5F1L.jpg","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/ni-region\/nitalbottrail\/nitalbottrailmasthead\/NI%5FTalbottrail%5F1L.jpg"},{"id":1697,"trail_name":"Tall Pines Snowmobile Club Trail","difficulty_num":2,"character":" Provincial Trails Week, Motorized-Use, OTC Member, Scenic, Tour","difficulty":2,"activities":"Snowmobiling","nearbyamenities":" Trailhead","length":"200 km","closest_town":"Utterson","longitude_num":-78.896599,"latitude_num":45.237849,"description":"The Tall Pines Snowmobile Club (TPSC) is located in Dorset, Ontario, in the heart of Southern Ontario's snowbelt region.

As water flowed over the Escarpment, a gorge was created which recessed southward. Roughly 12,700 years ago the area of Short Hills was flooded by the body of water known as Lake Warren. Glacial deposits filled the lake, burying the pre-existing gorge to 150 metres above sea level. \r\nThe lake water then retreated, leaving a series of rivers such as Twelve Mile Creek, which sliced through the glacial deposits, forming a jumble of small but steep hills and valleys, the "Short Hills."

On the other side of the trail network, you’ll find the Tamarack trail, which is an easy 3.2 km flat trail that winds through the tamaracks. It is accessed from the SunUp trail. \r\n\r\nLOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE? \r\n\r\nThe 6.8 km Lookout trial is a challenging loop that takes you through some great terrain. There is much less traffic on this trail but there are some spectacular views! \r\n\r\nWANT TO TAKE YOUR DOG FOR SKI? \r\n\r\nTake yourself over to Dudleys, which is an easy 2.2 km loop. You can start from the far end of the parking lot (away from the chalet). But don’t forget to check in\/pay at the chalet before you head out! Dogs must be OFF LEASH on this trail and if they do their business on the trail, use your pole to flick it into in the bush. Remember that dogs must be on their leash when near the chalet. \r\n\r\nLOOKING FOR SOME NIGHT SKIING? \r\n\r\nWe have 5.5 kms of trails that are lit for night skiing – the SunUp, SunDown and Northern Lights trails.  Lights go on at dusk and stay on until 9:30 pm every night.  Keep in mind that the chalet closes at 9 pm weeknights, 8 pm on Saturday and 6 pm on Sunday! \r\n\r\nSEE MEMBERSHIPS \r\n","surface":"Snow, Groomed, Ice, Natural","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/kamview-nordic-centre-trails\/kamview%20nordic%20centre%20trails%201.png","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/kamview-nordic-centre-trails\/kamview%20nordic%20centre%20trails%201.png"},{"id":1716,"trail_name":"Acclimatization Trail","difficulty_num":3,"character":"Natural, Scenic","difficulty":3,"activities":"Hiking & Walking","nearbyamenities":" Parking, Trailhead","length":"4 km Loop","closest_town":"Dorset","longitude_num":-78.845551,"latitude_num":45.160162,"description":"The Acclimation Trail is part of the Frost Centre Hiking Trails System.

It turns sharply to the left (south) to follow an old fence line and then climbs in a zig zag fashion to the top of the Outlier. Numerous crevices can be found at this north end of the outlier.\r\n\r\nOutliers are islands of bedrock that have become detatched from the main Escarpment. Most of them are capped by hard dolostone, while the valley floors that separate the outliers from the Escarpment are underlain by softer Queenston shale.\r\n\r\nAs glaciers melt and retreat, large volumes of water flow off the glacier, creating meltwater channels. The Violet Hill Meltwater Channel charged though the Mono Cliffs area and deepened the valley between the main Escarpment and the outliers. The waters flowed down from the north between the Orangeville Moraine and the Singhampton-Gibraltar Moraine, eventually making their way to an earlier Lake Erie.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outliers were likely already there before the Violet Hill Meltwater Channel came into existence, but the presence of the large volumes of water from this channel would have helped to deepen the valley and make the outliers more prominent. On top of the outlier, follow the Trail to the south; after 1 km it will join the white-blazed main Bruce Trail.\r\n\r\nTurn left (east). After 800 m turn north (left) on the blue-blazed South Outlier Trail again. You will be crossing open meadows with good views of the surrounding area.

The Bruce Trail is the oldest and longest marked hiking trail in Canada. It is 840 km long, with over 440 km of side trails. Every year more than 400,000 visits are made to the Trail as people walk,snowshoe, watch wildlife, take photographs and admire the glorious scenery of the Escarpment.\r\n\r\nThe Bruce Trail was instrumental in the Escarpment being named a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve by the United Nations in 1990 - one of only twelve such reserves in all of Canada.

Sherman Falls first appears at an 11.5 metre (38 foot) drop where Ancaster Creek flows over the escarpment. This waterfall, fed by springs from its headwaters, has a strong, continuous flow. Continue through the scenic ravine in the Tiffany Creek valley until you cross Wilson St.\r\n\r\nTiffany creek tumbles 6.5 metres from a broad valley above the escarpment into a V-shaped ravine below. A short side trail leads you to the waterfall. It's a rough walk, crossing talus slope with steep, narrow sections. \r\nWith file information from the Bruce Trail, for more information on this and other Bruce trails please purchase the Bruce Trail map and trail guidebook. The Bruce Trail is the oldest and longest marked hiking trail in Canada. It is 840 km long, with over 440 km of side trails. Every year more than 400,000 visits are made to the Trail as people walk, snowshoe, watch wildlife, take photographs and admire the glorious scenery of the Escarpment.\r\n\r\nThe Bruce Trail was instrumental in the Escarpment being named a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve by the United Nations in 1990 - one of only twelve such reserves in all of Canada. The Bruce Trail is a member of the Ontario Trails Council through affiliation with Hike Ontario. \r\n","surface":"Grass\/natural, Rock, Soil - Compacted, ","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/Central%5F1L.jpg","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/Central%5F1L.jpg"},{"id":2328,"trail_name":"Seguin River Water Trail","difficulty_num":2,"character":" Family Friendly, Scenic, Natural, Water, Wilderness","difficulty":2,"activities":"Canoe or Kayak, ","nearbyamenities":" Benches, Washrooms, Parking, Trailhead","length":"10 km","closest_town":"Parry Sound","longitude_num":-80.0331734,"latitude_num":45.4356229,"description":"PADDLING ON NINE MILE LAKE \r\n\r\nWhether you’re a beginner paddler or a seasoned racer, a dragon boater or a SUP fan, there’s a place for you in Georgian Nordic Paddling, a division of the Georgian Nordic Outdoor Activity Centre (GNOAC). \r\n\r\nLet expert coach Gord Cole—who’s coached at three world dragon boat championships and brought home 31 medals as a paddler—make your stroke smoother, cleaner and more efficient. \r\n\r\nSpending an hour with Cole and our other gurus will help you get the most out of every minute you spend on the water.

As a result, this group was formed in 1968 to provide information and instructions on the safe use and handling of snowmobiles. \r\nThe Club, consisting of about 25 members, was first known as the Bucke Sno Travellers, with the Charter President being Mr. Bill Adair. As the years went on and the popularity of the sport grew, Club membership increased and the name changed to the Tri-Town Sno Travellers. With the Club now functioning, the membership set out to access routes for specially groomed snowmobile trails. With several successful fund-raising events, enough money was set aside to help purchase two groomers. A Wintario Grant was applied for and received, and in 1978 the Club purchased an Alpine Snowmobile Groomer and Drag. \r\nLater a second and larger groomer and drag was purchased with the financial assistance of a number of local businesses. From its’ meager beginning in 1968 this Club has grown from 25 members to an active membership of approximately 550. The Club has also organized many social events which have helped to provide a day’s outing for all eager snowmobilers from the toddler to the senior.

Hidden among the low-rise and high-rise residential,commercial and institutional buildings, you will discover a rich variety of parks, gardens and streetscapes. \r\nSince the 1960s, many of these parks and gardens have been created through building demolitions, land exchanges, street closures, lease agreements, land purchases and the City’s development approval process for major projects. These parks and gardens have design features ranging from traditional to contemporary, from pastoral to urban.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisit two of the City’s traditional parks—Allan Gardens and Queen’s Park. At Allan Gardens, admire the extensive horticultural displays both outdoors and inside the ornate greenhouses. Queen’s Park provides a picturesque forested setting for the Provincial Parliament buildings. The more contemporary parks and gardens include quiet neighbourhood meeting spots, an award-winning park (e.g. Village of Yorkville Park) and outdoor recreation facilities. \r\nYou will visit extensively landscaped institutional grounds and the remains of a ravine where Taddle Creek once flowed but is now buried in a sewer. Many of these parks and gardens have been created over underground shopping concourses, parking lots and the subway, where a minimum of five feet of soil is provided for the healthy growth of trees. Opportunities to stop, look and listen are provided in these green spaces, most of which have seating, public art, water elements and nearby cafes and shopping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA variety of wildlife finds habitat and refuge in these same green spaces, particularly during spring and fall when birds and some butterflies are migrating. Species seen most often throughout the year are pigeons, squirrels and racoons. As you continue your exploration, you will encounter trees, shrubs and flowers growing along sidewalks and in planters on both public and private land. Trees are invaluable assets in improving the quality of urban life by reducing air pollution, creating shade, providing wildlife with food and habitat as well as beautifying neighbourhoods. Parks, gardens and streetscapes provide dramatic contrasts with surrounding historic and contemporary buildings. Note the wide variety of building materials used. Murals, sculptures and statues located in the parks, gardens and streetscapes along this Walk are representative of the impressive collection of public art that embodies the spirit of Toronto.

Therefore it is necessary to detour through the downtown and along highway 121. \r\n\r\nAt the North End of Cameron Lake the trail follows the Burnt River north eventually leading to Kinmount. The trip from Fenelon Falls north to Kinmount is 32 km but it takes you through some of the County's most scenic land. You travel through areas that except for the trail look like they've never been touched by man. \r\n\r\nThe trip from Fenelon Falls south to Lindsay is only 22 km's long and follows Sturgeon Lake.

The McClatchey Mine, located in Concession 10, Lot 7, is situated between Blue Lake and Gould Lake. A number of old pits and a large boiler may still be seen on the Mica Trail on Conservation Authority property. The mine was originally worked for phosphate by Snider and Freeman of Perth in the 1870s, then it was sold to McClatchey and Hayden of Belleville who started working it for mica. \r\n\r\nIt was acquired by J.W. Trousdale, a prominent citizen of Sydenham, in 1901, and was mined steadily until 1912. At this time it was abandoned because water had seeped in from the lake. The main shaft was over 100 feet deep, and opened out to a chamber 8 feet by 30 feet. On the property were a boarding house, trimming-shed, stable, forge, and other buildings. No power machinery was used, and hoisting from the pits was done by a horse-derrick and whims. \r\n\r\nFrom 1967 to 1973, the CRCA acquired the lands that now make up  Gould Lake Conservation Area. Much of the land was purchased from Loughborough Township. Several private landowners sold to the CRCA including as well, including the Dickey, Anglin, Seymour, and the Sands families. \r\n\r\nThere are a variety of admission fees to the area. 3 for children 12 and under, $5.50 for adults, max $14 per car.

But be sure to wear hightop shoes and bring a compass and map! This site is a provincially significant wetland known as a bog. This bog wetland contains partially decomposed plant material. Near the centre of the site, sphagnum moss is covered by low shrubs and plants. At the edge is an upland forest bog. This bog ecosystem was much larger and began as an open water area over 12,000 years ago. Water ponded in the low flat land behind the adjacent Onondaga Escarpment, which prevented surface water from draining south to Lake Erie. \r\nOver time this open water area filled in, as plants died and more plants grew. Due to the underlying saturated conditions the bog remains an acidic environment with low nutrients. The result is a domed bog with unique plants able to withstand the acidic and low nutrient site conditions. This Conservation Area also helps to protect habitat of national, provincial and local significance. A number of unique plants and animals flourish here, as does a large forested area and shrub areas to house deer and migrating birds and butterflies. Historical information on climate trends and plant communities are also described through the site's peat layers. Today, the Wainfleet Bog Conservation protects and enhances these features, with past peat extractive areas being rehabilitated to more natural conditions. \r\nDirections: From Toronto take the QEW towards Niagara.

It is believed the name, originally spelled Warden, referred to a warden for the Township of York who lived in the area. Although a surveyed road that separated lots 32 and 33 existed here before the 1840's, it was named considerably later. The 1910 Goad's Atlas records the road as Warden Avenue. The valley's contour has been shaped by the erosion of Massey Creek through the Halton glacial till plain (Toronto's last glacial deposit) and through several underlying glacial deposits. \r\nThe shoreline of glacial Lake Iroquois intersects Massey Creek near Byng Park. About 12,000 years ago, Massey Creek actually fed into a sheltered bay that had formed behind a large south-west projecting sand spit -- an early forerunner of the Toronto Island. Warden Woods was acquired from the Sisters of St. Joseph by the then Township of Scarborough in January 1959.

Many chimneys dispatched smoke and steam and the valley earned the name Smokey Hollow.

Fire claimed several of the mills and the final blow came in 1912 when a railway was constructed through the valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA placard at the waterfall lookout displays a picture of railway construction in 1912, and, the industry that was around it.

The Trail quickly climbs down the Escarpment and continues along the cliff face. It then ascends the Escarpment via a switchback, to emerge at the top near the buildings at Woodend.\r\n\r\nThe United Empire Loyalist family of Peter Lampman fled New York State in 1779 to establish what became a 650 hectare grant on the top of a hill known as St. Anthony’s Nose, now known as Woodend. During the War of 1812, a three gun battery occupied its heights, commanding a fine sweep of the lands below. The poet Archibald Lampman, grandson of the original settler, was a frequent visitor and wrote several poems about his grandfather’s estate.\r\n\r\nParts of the original two houses were incorporated into the present structure, built in 1931 and ’32. The Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority now manages it as a 40 hectare parcel of land incorporating recreational and picnic facilities. Continue to follow the white blazes past the buildings at Woodend and along the Escarpment edge. You will pass several interesting rock formations that are characteristic of the Niagara Escarpment in this area.\r\n\r\nYou will also see splendid views of the vineyards and orchards on the flat plain below the Escarpment. About 600 m past the intersection with the Paul Naray Silurian Trail you will find the intersection with another blue-blazed side trail. Turn left and follow this side trail roughly 800 m back to your car.\r\n\r\nWith file information from the Bruce Trail, for more information on this and other Bruce trails please purchase the Bruce Trail map and trail guidebook. The Bruce Trail is the oldest and longest marked hiking trail in Canada. It is 840 km long, with over 440 km of side trails. Every year more than 400,000 visits are made to the Trail as people walk, snowshoe, watch wildlife, take photographs and admire the glorious scenery of the Escarpment.\r\n\r\nThe Bruce Trail was instrumental in the Escarpment being named a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve by the United Nations in 1990 - one of only twelve such reserves in all of Canada. \r\n","surface":"Rock, Soil - Compacted","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/NEOldGrowth%5F3L.jpg","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/NEOldGrowth%5F3L.jpg"},{"id":1920,"trail_name":"Wooden Sticks Trail","difficulty_num":2,"character":"Urban","difficulty":2,"activities":"Hiking & Walking, Running, Cycling - Roads & Paths, Cycling - Off-Road","nearbyamenities":"","length":"2 KM","closest_town":"Uxbridge","longitude_num":-79.1189,"latitude_num":44.09748,"description":"  \r\nThe Wooden Sticks Trail provides a varied walking, running or cycling experience.

Across the road is the Wooden Sticks Golf Club, one of the top golf courses in Canada. \r\nDrop in to visit the Ontario Golf Hall of Fame, or perhaps for a meal or snack - they have a great Sunday brunch. The history of the area records that some of the land now occupied by the housing development was sold in 1835 to Abraham Acton, and then to Edward Acton in 1872, and to Isaac J. Gould the next year. The Acton and Gould names are still familiar in the Uxbridge area. \r\nThe trail turns north (left) onto a gravel path that leads into Elgin Park, Uxbridge’s main municipal park. Further into the park, there are public washrooms and a play area for children. The history of Elgin Park goes back to the 1860’s, when folk from the hamlet of Uxbridge went for picnics in what was then known as the “South Woods”. \r\nThe trail veers to the right just past the pond into a heavily wooded area, through which a path has been cut. This path enables you to enjoy a “deep woods” experience just a few steps from the road and the houses. It runs along a ridge beside a stream, with its own beaver dam.

After a brief climb up a steep slope, the trail pathway opens out onto Sims Lock Road. At this point (about 4 km from the start), the route follows Sims Lock Road to Abbey Road, where the trail path resumes to the Village of York. In general this very scenic area consists of agricultural land mixed with small settlements. \r\n\r\nThe immediate trail habitat consists largely of Carolinian forest, e.g. black walnut, and high, dense undergrowth with goldenrod, ragweed, and many creeping vines. There are many opportunities to access or view scenic river vistas on the right, and there are significant stretches of field on the left. Both banks of the river are often in view, and most of the trail is shaded by mature trees During migration large numbers of waterfowl may be encountered along the river. \r\n\r\nMany breeding birds may also be seen, some of them rare. They include the rare Least Bittern, Great Blue and Green Herons, Wood Duck, Northern Harrier, Yellow-billed Cuckoo, Eastern Screech-Owl, Belted Kingfisher, Red-headed Woodpecker as well as other woodpeckers, Least Flycatcher and other flycatchers, Eastern Kingbird, Warbling Vireo and other vireos, Northern Rough-winged Swallow and other swallows, Gray Catbird, many warblers including Common Yellowthroat and American Redstart, as well as blackbirds and sparrows such as Field, Song and Chipping. \r\n\r\nOf special note is the existence of a nesting pair of Bald Eagles located along the west bank of the river across from the trail head in Seneca Park.

Whether taking a hike along the Ausable Gorge or within Rock Glen's important Carolinian forest, you'll see many trees, plants and wildlife that are provincially distinct to this area. \r\n\r\nThe park is home to the Arkona Lions Museum and Information Centre which houses an impressive collection of Devonian Era fossils and artifacts found in the local area. There are stairs, boardwalks and bridge allowing visitors to safely explore the steep sides of the glen and the 10.7-metre high waterfall just upstream of the Ausable River. Visitors and amateur archaelogists from all parts of North America have found many fossils in the exposed beds dating back 350 million years. Scientific names for these ancient treasures include crinoids, brachiopods and trilobites. \r\n\r\nThe story of civilization around Rock Glen dates back to the time when the Paleo or Early First Nations peoples utilized the nearby hills to hunt the barren ground caribou some 10,000 years ago.

If you would like more information, please contact Trish Anthony at anthony_2@sympatico.ca.

For images and descriptions of some of Hamilton’s waterfalls visit http:\/\/www.waterfalls.hamilton.ca\/ \r\n\r\nGetting to Hamilton’s Waterfalls \r\n\r\nMost of the waterfalls in Hamilton are situated on the Niagara escarpment (a UNESCO world biosphere site) in and along the Bruce Trail and can require anywhere from minimal walking to a long distance hike to access. Because the waterfalls are situated beside steep drops and difficult to access locations it is important to stick to marked paths and viewing areas. For information on how to safely access Hamilton’s waterfalls by bus or car as well as park visit http:\/\/www.waterfalls.hamilton.ca\/ \r\n\r\nOntario Trails do not own or manage any trails. we encourage all trail users to check with the identified manager before using the trail.

With a multi-purpose, year-round use, the OVRT will connect three of Lanark County’s prettiest towns – Carleton Place, Almonte and Pakenham.  \r\n\r\nThe OVRT has been an ambitious, multi-year project to repurpose a section of the former Canadian Pacific Railway line running from Carleton Place to Mississippi Mills, part of a larger 296-kilometre corridor between Smiths Falls and Mattawa. The railway line rehabilitation project involved partnerships between Lanark County, the County of Renfrew, and the Township of Papineau-Cameron, spanned several years. \r\n\r\nAs a transportation route, the OVRT is a one-size-fits-all trail, offering users stellar scenery and world-class views along its roughly 30-kilometre route. A safe, level, gravel-or-paved trail for cycling, walking, all-terrain vehicles and snowmobiles makes the trail desirable for all users. \r\n\r\nThe OVRT will allow users to travel between communities for day trips or longer getaways. Traveling by bike from Carleton Place to Almonte on the OVRT will take approximately 40 minutes, each way, while adventurous cyclists can choose to extend their journey to Pakenham, for an additional 45-minute ride, one-way. \r\n\r\nCyclists and pedestrians in particular will enjoy traveling on a trail that is separated from vehicular traffic, creating a safe and pristine natural environment for people of all ages looking for outdoor recreation and leisure opportunities. Families with young children will enjoy traveling on a route where young people can experiment with riding a bike in a safe area. \r\n\r\nIn winter, the OVRT will open options for snowmobilers to travel off-road and separated from larger vehicular traffic. Close attention has also been paid to ensure the OVRT will be accessible for everyone, including persons with disabilities. \r\n\r\nThe Lanark County OVRT will connect to the longest recreational trail in the world, the Trans Canada Trail, at its trailhead in Carleton Place. In the Ottawa Valley, the connection to the Trans Canada Trail will provide even greater access for pedestrian and cycling transportation, effectively creating a corridor running from Ottawa to Mississippi Mills where travelers never need to step foot on a roadway. \r\n\r\nCounty of Renfrew Trails \r\n\r\nTrails Use Policy \r\n\r\nCode of Conduct \r\n\r\nManagement Plan \r\n\r\nNEWS \r\n\r\nAward Winning Trail \r\n\r\nEconomic Opportunity \r\n\r\nNews = Progress \r\n\r\nMaps \r\n\r\nOttawa Valley ATV Club \r\n\r\nRenfrew County ATV Club \r\n\r\nCarleton Place \r\n\r\nPetewawa \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNorthern Ontario Travel \r\n","surface":"Gravel, Stone Dust, Natural, Asphalt","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/ottawa-valley-recreational-trail\/ottawa%20valley%20recreational%20trail%205.jpeg","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/ottawa-valley-recreational-trail\/ottawa%20valley%20recreational%20trail%205.jpeg"},{"id":2158,"trail_name":"Stephen's Gulch Conservation Area ","difficulty_num":2,"character":"Natural","difficulty":2,"activities":"Cross Country Skiing, Cycling - Off-Road, Hiking & Walking, Running","nearbyamenities":"","length":3,"closest_town":"Bowmanville","longitude_num":-78.6793468,"latitude_num":43.9671529,"description":"Located north of Bowmanville, the Stephen's Gulch Conservation Area borders a significant portion of the Soper Creek. \r\n\r\nThe Conservation Area protects a large area of deciduous forest and coniferous forest\/swamp that help maintain both water quantity (through seeps and springs) and water temperature along this section the Soper Creek. \r\n\r\nStephen's Gulch Conservation Area also includes a portion of the provincially significant Soper Valley Area of Natural and Scientific Interest (ANSI). \r\n\r\nExit 401 at Liberty Street in Bowmanville (432), take Liberty Street North to Concession Road 4, turn right on Concession Road 4, turn left onto Bethesda Rd, take 1st right onto Stephens Mill Rd. \r\n\r\nOnly In Clarington \r\n\r\nWalk, hike, cycle, run or take your dog.

Continuing restoration work within Westside Marsh and the land connecting it to the Bowmanville Marsh will provide more quality wildlife habitat areas, and enhance existing habitat areas that are already important to many wildlife species for both breeding and feeding activities. \r\n\r\nThis Conservation Area provides good habitat for nesting birds and acts as an important stopover point for waterfowl and shorebirds migrating along the north shore of Lake Ontario. In addition to their importance to wildlife, both Bowmanville Marsh and Westside Marsh provide many other important functions that are typical of the few remaining coastal wetlands found along this northern section of the Lake Ontario shoreline. \r\n\r\nAs result, these two marshes are designated as provincially significant wetlands and are part of a long-term study, the Durham Region Coastal Wetland Monitoring Project. To help you get a closer look at this important area, the Bowmanville\/Westside Marshes Conservation Area has a 1.5 Km looping trail around the upland area between the two wetlands. \r\n\r\nThis trail is just the right length for little ones and is generally stroller and wheelchair friendly.

It comprises just about 500 acres of forest and swamp land, and includes two creeks, with beaver dams and other ponds.  Records suggest that the property has not been logged since the original logging of pine in the 1870s, and recent checks have indicated many trees that are at least 100 years old.  Because of the local relief on the property there are uplands with stands of oak, maple and basswood, intermixed with some birch, beech and ash.  In the lower lands there are old stands of cedar and hemlock with the usual mix of tamarack and balsam.  Along the creeks there are many varieties of shrubs and herbs, with wild flowers almost everywhere. \r\n\r\nBirds and animals are in evidence throughout the property.  Among the many animals are deer and moose, coyote, otter, with the occasional visit by North Hastings Elk.\r\n\r\nThe trail system is laid out in loops which allow hikers and skiers to choose the length and difficulty that suits their individual preferences.  At present there is approximately 8 kilometres of marked trails.  Please note that all Motorized Vehicles are prohibited, but cyclists are welcome.  There are two parking areas both of which are accessible off North Steenburg Lake Road about one kilometre west of Trudy's store and gas on Highway 62 South.  The first parking area allows access to the century old cabin which is rented to the public by Crowe Valley Conservation, and is the start of the original trail system established by Jack McGeachie many years ago.  This is a short and fairly level loop that is a good starter for a family outing.  The second parking area is marked with a sign "McGeachie Conservation Area Hiking Trails" at the road.  This is the entrance to the much larger and more challenging portion of the trail system.  We suggest good quality footwear for hikers, especially during the winter and spring, when you will probably encounter some deep snow and wet or muddy spots in the trail.  During the winter, snow shoes are an excellent way to get around. \r\n\r\nAddress: 363 Steenburg Lake Rd N, Gilmour, ON K0L 1W0 \r\n\r\nMAP \r\n\r\nInformation provided by North Hastings Trails website \r\n\r\nLearn more about the area from Trip Advisor - \r\n\r\n \r\n","surface":"Natural","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/activity\/00041625southwestern_375x175.jpg","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/activity\/00041625southwestern_375x175.jpg"},{"id":2201,"trail_name":"Settler's Trail","difficulty_num":1,"character":"Flat with some incline","difficulty":1,"activities":"Hiking & Walking, Running, Cycling - Off-Road, ","nearbyamenities":"","length":"3.1km","closest_town":"Kemptville","longitude_num":-75.66575,"latitude_num":45.03388,"description":"Settler's Trail is a 6.2 kilometer out & back trail, good for all skill levels. \r\n\r\nThis trail runs from the Settlers Grant community through the Ferguson Forest Centre. \r\n\r\nThis recreational trail is relatively flat, with some incline and has gravel across the length of the trail. \r\n\r\nParking is available on the west side of County Road 44, north of Kemptville Public School, or at the east end of the trail within the Ferguson Forest Centre. \r\n\r\n  \r\n","surface":"Gravel","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/activity\/activity_biking_offroad_header.jpg","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/activity\/activity_biking_offroad_header.jpg"},{"id":2172,"trail_name":"Perth Outfitters Ice Skate Trail","difficulty_num":2,"character":" Scenic, Natural, Urban, Ice Trail","difficulty":2,"activities":"Canoeing & Kayaking, Skating","nearbyamenities":" Skate Trail","length":0.4,"closest_town":"Perth","longitude_num":-76.2443581,"latitude_num":44.8998774,"description":"This gem of a trail winds through the woods adjacent to the Tay River, wraps around a log cabin, past the shinny rink and campfire, where people gather and marshmallow sticks are plentiful.

The land is mostly flat with gardens, parks and neighbourhoods lining the way. In May, tulips bloom along the canal during the Canadian Tulip Festival, followed by a variety of flowers in the summer and fall colours in the autumn. \r\n\r\nBicycle rentals of all types are available at RentABike, located across the street from the Fairmont Château Laurier under the Plaza Bridge, and at Escape Bicycle Tours & Rentals on nearby Sparks Street. Both also offer guided tours – group and personalized – for all cycling levels. For more about exploring this area by bike, see our Rideau Canal Family-Friendly Bike Trail webpage. \r\n\r\nAs you explore the pathways, keep an eye out for signage and outdoor exhibits highlighting the waterway’s historical and cultural significance. Rideau Canal Promenade installations are located at the following seven sites: Ottawa Locks, Shaw Centre, Pretoria Bridge, Lansdowne Park, Dows Lake, Central Experimental Farm, and Hartwells Lockstation. \r\n\r\nOn the Water \r\n\r\nFor a relaxing urban experience, rent a canoe, paddleboat, kayak or standup paddle board from the Marina at Dows Lake Pavilion. Paddle around the canal’s romantic nooks, urban vistas and small islands – you might encounter ducks, see fish underwater and spot beautiful birds! If you have your own boat, you can put-in at several locations along the canal. \r\n\r\nFor more on paddling the canal and other Ottawa waterways, see our Paddling paradise – flatwater fun in Ottawa webpage. \r\n\r\nIn Winter \r\n\r\nOne of Ottawa’s iconic experiences – and a bucket list item for many people around the world – is skating on the Rideau Canal Skateway, which is the world’s largest skating rink as designated by the Guinness Book Of World Records. When the canal surface is sufficiently frozen (early January to early March each year, depending on the weather), you can skate on the maintained ice for 7.8 kilometres (4.8 miles) from downtown Ottawa to Carleton University via Dows Lake. The Skateway surface is equivalent to more than 90 Olympic-sized hockey rinks and you can skate for free, 24 hours a day! Along the way, you’ll see distance markers, heated huts, washrooms and food kiosks. There’s nothing like gliding along the frozen canal, sipping a hot chocolate and eating a delicious, doughy, BeaverTail pastry – the sweet treat was born in Ottawa in 1978. \r\n\r\nInformation from the Tourism Ottawa Website \r\n\r\nStay up to date \r\n\r\nSign-up for the Ottawa Tourism Newsletter and we’ll keep you updated on events and ideas for planning your next trip to Ottawa. \r\n\r\nSign up  \r\n","surface":"Ice, Water, Asphalt, Road","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/activity\/canoe\/TrailEtiquette_3L.jpg","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/mastheads-all\/activity\/canoe\/TrailEtiquette_3L.jpg"},{"id":2196,"trail_name":"Wilderness Way - North Hastings Scenic Route #2","difficulty_num":1,"character":"Scenic, Heritage, Auto-Route","difficulty":1,"activities":"Cycling - Roads & Paths, Motorcycling, Auto-Route","nearbyamenities":"","length":"60km","closest_town":"Maple Leaf","longitude_num":-77.818239,"latitude_num":45.287597,"description":"Wilderness Way - North Hastings Scenic Route #2 \r\n\r\nThis is a road route designed for motorcycle, cycling on-road and autos. \r\n\r\nThis scenic route has 10 Points of Interest.

He was appointed Speaker of the Assembly in 1815 and occupied that important office almost continuously until 1837. \r\n\r\nPapineau quickly became the recognized leader of the patriotes, the French-Canadian reformers, and his political strength was such that in 1820 the governor, Lord Dalhousie, sought to gain his support by offering Papineau a seat on the Executive Council. Papineau accepted and then resigned almost immediately when he found that he could not influence policy. He came increasingly to dislike the control that the British government exercised over the political life of the colony. He played a major role in the events leading to the Rebellion of 1837 in Lower Canada, although he took no part in the rebellion itself. \r\n\r\nFollowing the military defeat of the Patriotes, Lower Canada was merged with Upper Canada under the Union Act. The Canadiens had a narrow majority in the new political entity, and with continued emigration of English-speakers to Ontario, this dominance was short lived. Eight years after the Union, a responsible elected government was set up in the united Province of Canada. The instability of this new regime eventually led to the formation of the Great Coalition. In 1867, there was another major constitutional change and formation of the Canadian Confederation. \r\n\r\nFor more information on this and the 13 routes that make up the North Hastings Scenic Routes see: \r\n\r\n \r\n","surface":"Road, Asphalt, Gravel","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/tourism%20regions\/haliburton%20highlands%20to%20the%20ottawa%20valley%20rto11\/scenicroutes2.JPG","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/tourism%20regions\/haliburton%20highlands%20to%20the%20ottawa%20valley%20rto11\/scenicroutes2.JPG"},{"id":2184,"trail_name":"Stirling to Madoc Junction Multi-Use Trail","difficulty_num":3,"character":"Rail Trail, Motorized, Scenic","difficulty":3,"activities":"Snowmobiling, ATVing, Cycling - Off-Road, Equestrian, Winter (Fat) Biking, ","nearbyamenities":" Benches, Parking, Trailhead","length":"20km","closest_town":"Stirling","longitude_num":-77.4905576,"latitude_num":44.3143981,"description":"The Stirling to Madoc Junction Trail is a four-season, multi-use recreational trail that follows an old railway line linking Hastings County.

Kirby on behalf of the art gallery) \r\n\r\nThe caboose rests on the traces of the Central Ontario Railway line, which stretched from Prince Edward County through Bancroft, Maynooth, Lake St. Peter and Wallace.

It's a good two-day outing for novice canoeists or advanced paddlers looking for a leisurely getaway. \r\n\r\nAccess\/Parking: Egan Chute Provincial Park is 10.5 kilometers east of Bancroft, along Highway 28; the public access road is northeast of the highway bridge. Also, since it's a river route, you'll have to shuttle a second vehicle to the public launch at the west end of Combermere, along Highway 62. \r\n\r\nNot far from the starting point, about 400 m, is Egan Chute itself to the left of the cascade is a short but fairly steep 50-meter portage that is regularly used. \r\n\r\nJust beyond Egan Chutes are two more drops - Middle Chute and Farm Chute. Both have portages (100 meters on the left and 200 meters on the right), but these are not regularly used and can be difficult to follow. The first trail keeps close to the rivers edge, the second heads almost directly up and over a knob of granite. Both also have campsites on the east bank. \r\n\r\nOther sites are found not far downstream, one situated on one of the many sandbars found between the Great Bend (where the river takes a dramatic twist to the northeast) and King's Marsh. Other sites for camping can be found further downstream. Parts of the river, have large sections of deciduous swamps and forest leaves, suits the York's Native name, Shawashkong (the river of marshes). \r\n\r\nIf you're not that interested in making your own bush camp, it is possible to paddle a full six-to-eight-hour day and end your trip at the alternative take-out at the Boulter Road bridge. You can book a cabin at any of the local resort. \r\n\r\nIf you paddle only the first half of the route, you will miss the Conroy Marsh route altogether. \r\n\r\nLocated just below the Boulter bridge, there are three sets of swifts, Conroy Rapids, that can easily be run or lined down. \r\n\r\nBecause of its size the Conroy Marsh is a easy place to find yourself lost in. A couple of kilometers downstream from Conroy Rapids the waterway spreads out over 2,400 hectares, with Robinson Lake to the west and Winter Lake, Garden Lake, One Mile Bay and the mouth of the Little Mississippi River to the east. To keep on track, it's best to stay in the center of the main channel and eventually you'll meet up with Negeek Lake, where the York River flushes into the Madawaska River. \r\n\r\nFrom here it's just a short paddle west, under the Highway 62 bridge, and then left toward the public launch in Combermere. Or you could travel east on the Madawaska and take in a week of adventurous whitewater paddling all the way down to the Ottawa River. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nTime: 1-2 days\r\nNumber of portages: 3\r\nLongest portage: 200 meters \r\n\r\nLevel of Difficulty: Novice - portages around Egan, Middle and Farm Chute are extremely steep but the river itself is a novice route. \r\n\r\nAlternative access: Put in from the Boulter Road bridge, reached by turning east off Boulter Road onto Hass Road, and then left on Havergal Road. You can also access the river at the end of McPhees Bay Road off Highway 515. \r\n\r\nAlternative route: The route can be divided into two day trips by making use of the Boulter Road bridge access and staying at area resorts or campgrounds. \r\n\r\nInformation provided by Couples Resort. \r\n","surface":"Water","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/york-river-water-trail\/york%20river%201.png","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/york-river-water-trail\/york%20river%201.png"},{"id":2244,"trail_name":"Windermere Basin Trail","difficulty_num":2,"character":" Dog Friendly, Scenic, Urban, Looped Trail, Largely along sidewa","difficulty":2,"activities":"Hike, Walk, Running, Cycling - Roads & Paths, ","nearbyamenities":" Accommodations, Bird Watching, Restaurants, Benches, Washrooms, Parking, Trailhead","length":1.5,"closest_town":"Hamilton","longitude_num":-79.7764348,"latitude_num":43.2672084,"description":"Environmentalist Lynda Lukasik remembers when Windermere Basin was an industrial cesspool and finds it exciting to show people how restoration efforts have transformed it into a naturalized wildlife area in the shadow of heavy industry. \r\n\r\nLukasik, executive director of Environment Hamilton led a public education walk Saturday, along with others, through the Windermere Trail that starts at Eastport Drive and circles around to where the Red Hill Creek flows into the harbour. \r\n\r\nWith heavy industry like steelmaker ArcelorMittal Dofasco across the waterway as a backdrop, Lukasik spoke happily about seeing coyotes, small deer, feral animals and new bird species over the past year. \r\n\r\n"It's exciting to talk about places where (good) things are happening," she said.

It's now a wetland," Lukasik said. \r\n\r\nThe majority of the sediment was from the sewage treatment plant nearby, she added. \r\n\r\nThere is now a shoreline bird habitat with special features such as nesting boxes, along with a grated fishway to prevent invasive carp from taking over other species. \r\n\r\nThe walking paths are built over industrial fill, Lukasik said. \r\n\r\nJoining Environment Hamilton on the walk were birders and a Redeemer University environmental science student, who gave a talk about how the sweet white clover found there is an invasive species in North America. \r\n\r\n"It makes the soil here unsuitable to the species that should be growing here. It also steals energy from plants around it," said Anna Marie Benjamins. \r\n\r\nLen Manning of the Hamilton Naturalists' Club educated the group about the tree swallows along the walk — and the numerous nesting boxes built for them there. \r\n\r\n"Any birds like this that eat insects only are declining (in population)," he said, adding that while there is no definitive reason, the insect population itself is declining, possibly due to pesticides. \r\n\r\nThe good news: "This is the largest colony of tree swallows I've ever seen." \r\n\r\nLukasik led the walkers closer to where the Red Hill empties into the harbour. \r\n\r\n"In the past," she said, "you would have seen a lot of orange plumes coming up from the smokestacks of the industries. It was huge billowing clouds of smoke." \r\n\r\nOne of the benefits of restoring habitats and wetlands is that they bring people closer to industry to keep an eye on what's going on, she said. \r\n\r\nHamilton resident Sarah Hemingway, who moved here two years ago from Kitchener, said this was her first such educational walk. \r\n\r\n"I wanted to connect with (like-minded) people … you get to know the people in the city on walks like this." \r\n\r\ncfragomeni@thespec.com \r\n\r\n905-526-3392 | @CarmatTheSpec \r\n","surface":"Asphalt","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/events\/hamilton%20hike%20club.png","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/events\/hamilton%20hike%20club.png"},{"id":2352,"trail_name":"Grand Central Valley Land Trail","difficulty_num":1,"character":" Dog Friendly, Natural, Urban, Flat","difficulty":1,"activities":"Hiking & Walking, Cycling - Roads & Paths, Cycling - Off-Road, ","nearbyamenities":" Accommodations, Restaurants, Benches, Washrooms, Parking, Trailhead","length":"1.98 km","closest_town":"Bradford","longitude_num":-79.5881601,"latitude_num":44.1080494,"description":"Location: Stretches from Aishford Road to Holland Street West \r\n\r\nTrail Length: 1.98 km \r\n\r\nNumber of Access Points: 8 \r\n\r\nDifficulty: Easy \r\n\r\nSurface Type: Paved and Granular \r\n\r\nDog Friendly: Yes \r\n\r\nCyclist Friendly: Yes \r\n\r\nWith onformation from the Town of Bradford West Gwillimbury \r\n","surface":"","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/grand-central-valley-land-trail\/bradford%20west%20gwillimbury%20trail%20month.png","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/grand-central-valley-land-trail\/bradford%20west%20gwillimbury%20trail%20month.png"},{"id":2242,"trail_name":"Carroll Trail","difficulty_num":2,"character":" OTC Member, Scenic, Urban, Historic","difficulty":2,"activities":"Hike, Walk, Running, Cycling - Roads & Paths, ","nearbyamenities":" Bird Watching, Benches, Washrooms, Parking, Trailhead","length":5,"closest_town":"Tillsonburg","longitude_num":-80.723314,"latitude_num":42.854385,"description":"This 5.0 km loop is full of beautiful vistas and has several bridges to cross.

The "mapped" trail network within Limerick Forest consists of approximately 180 km of trails ranging in size from "single track" to emergency access roads suitable for full-sized vehicles. In addition, approximately 30 km of "groomed" snowmobile trails are maintained by the Leeds & Grenville Snowmobile Association. A number of information kiosks have been installed at various locations throughout Limerick Forest. Mosaics of air photos and trail maps, 911 locations, parking areas and public service announcements may be found on these kiosks. \r\n\r\nThe current "multi-use" philosophy in Limerick encourages flexibility, consideration and respect amongst all user groups.  There are very few restrictions on activities occurring within the forest.  They include no permanent structures (i.e., tree stands), no overnight camping (and camp fires), and no motorized vehicles on the hiking trails north of the Limerick Chalet.  In addition, specific activities may be restricted where the safety of the public or the well-being of the forest is a concern (i.e., seasonal restrictions regarding the use of motorized vehicles on the trails during the spring season).  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nRecreational activities in Limerick Forest can be divided into two broad categories; motorized and non-motorized.  Motorized activities include the use of dirt bikes, all terrain vehicles (ATV's) and snowmobiles.  Non-motorized pursuits include mountain biking, cross country skiing, geocaching, horse-back riding, bird watching, hiking and hunting.  It is the responsibility of each and every individual visiting Limerick Forest to ensure that they have met all of the legal requirements necessary to participate in their activity of choice.  Please see the FAQ section for further details. \r\n\r\nAlthough trail development and maintenance is the responsibility of the Counties, it should be noted that many of the trails in Limerick Forest today are the result of countless hours of hard work by volunteer members of various organizations including local motorcycle, mountain biking and ATV clubs.  These volunteers also participate in trail maintenance activities on a regular basis throughout the year and the trail network would not be what it is today without their assistance. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe development of additional trails throughout Limerick Forest will eventually be necessary due to the increasing demands on the existing trail network.  An assessment of the recreation\/tourism potential for Limerick and any appropriate increased development to support those activities will be based on a comprehensive analysis of the current and anticipated demands on the forest by all potential user groups.  Collection of quantitative data to support such an analysis will be a program priority. \r\n\r\nThe Limerick Forest Long Range Plan (LFLRP) identifies the significance of recreational activities in Limerick and the need to provide a "... wide range of quality recreational opportunities ..." listing the following strategies to achieve this goal: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tIdentify and design a recreational trail system that will meet the needs of all current and potential users.\r\n\tIdentify other (non-trail) type recreational opportunities (e.g. tobogganing, wildlife viewing, picnicking and camping).\r\n\tPrepare a code of conduct for trail and other recreational users.\r\n\tContinue to provide traditional recreational past practices such as hunting.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Twenty Year Forest Management Plan (FMP) recognizes those strategies and has identified the following objectives to help attain the goal of providing a wide range of quality recreational opportunities.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\tMaintain a diversity of forest cover types and stand structures to provide for a diversity of recreational uses. \r\n\tEnsure that timber management activities (e.g. harvest, renewal, and maintenance) are undertaken in a manner which eliminates or minimizes conflicts with other users of the forest.\r\n\tEnsure that recreational uses do not degrade or adversely affect the forest, its access roads and trails or other values.\r\n\tPromote the use of Limerick Forest as a public resource for forestry and natural environment education.\r\n\tProvide a safe environment for the public use of Limerick Forest.\r\n\tMaintain the road and trail network of Limerick Forest in sufficient condition for recreation use.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrategies to accomplish the above are described in the FMP. \r\n\r\nFACEBOOK \r\n\r\nWebsite \r\n\r\nVideo \r\n","surface":"Natural, Stone Dust, Boardwalk, Gravel","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/limerick%20forest\/limerick%20forest%203.png","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/limerick%20forest\/limerick%20forest%203.png"},{"id":2257,"trail_name":"Apple Pie Trail - Tourism Trail","difficulty_num":1,"character":" Culturally Significant, Tourism Trail","difficulty":1,"activities":"Hiking & Walking, Cycling - Roads & Paths, ","nearbyamenities":" Accommodations, Restaurants, Benches, Parking","length":"","closest_town":"The Blue Mountains","longitude_num":-80.3251967,"latitude_num":44.5115542,"description":"IT ALL ABOUT?  \r\n\r\nThe Apple Pie Trail is a Culinary Adventure Trail and Apple Pie is just the beginning! \r\n\r\nInspired by South Georgian Bay's apple-growing history, we bring together culinary, shopping, adventure, farms and other local experiences that celebrate our history and reinterpret the mighty apple for the 21st century.  \r\n\r\nMake The Most  Of the Trail  \r\n\r\nWe have created some fabulous tools for you, to help you make the most of the trail.View or download our latest Brochure and Trail Map to start planning your Apple Pie Trail Experience.  \r\n\r\nBecause there is so much to see and do on our tour, we always suggest making it a two (or more) day plan.

Sturdy footwear, plenty of water and a park map and compass is recommended. Killarney Provincial Park offers five day use hiking trails plus may other hiking opportunities. \r\n\r\nChikanishing Trail 3 km (1.5 hours) moderate\r\nThis trail winds along the park’s southern boundary and crosses a series of small ridges and then ending at a wave-washed point on Georgian Bay. Vegetation is typical of the rocky, windswept terrain of Georgian Bay, though taller pine and oak have flourished in wind-sheltered spots where soil has accumulated. Old iron rings used for mooring lines during logging days can still be seen along the trail. Interpretive plaques tell the colourful history of this part of Georgian Bay. \r\n\r\nCranberry Bog Trail 4 km (2.5 hours) moderate\r\nHikers along the trail pass some of the park’s loveliest scenery. Bogs, marshes and swamps are home to Sundew, Leatherleaf, Pitcher Plant and Cranberry. Beaver feed piles can be seen along the way. Many birds frequent this trail’s habitats and Blanding’s Turtles make an occasional appearance in Cranberry Bog. Look for evidence of glaciation—smooth rock surfaces, striations and chatter marks. \r\n\r\nGranite Ridge Trail 2 km (1 hour) moderate\r\nProviding views of the unique La Cloche Mountains for which Killarney is renowned the trail winds through old fields and forests and climbs to a ridge with two lookouts over the park. To the south, your eye moves along the shore from Collin’s Inlet and Philip Edward Island to the expanse of Georgian Bay. To the north, see the spectacular La Cloche Mountains. \r\n\r\nLake of The Woods Trail 3.5 km (3 hour) moderate to difficult\r\nThis loop trail encircles Lake of the Woods, traveling through a variety of forest types, from old growth stands to elevated rocky outcrops. These outcrops offer excellent views of Silver Peak, six kilometres to the west and Lake of the Woods below. At one point, the trail descends to the lakeshore where a short boardwalk connects to the lake’s only island. \r\n\r\nThe Crack 6 km (4 hour), difficult\r\nThe view from the top of Killarney Ridge is absolutely stunning. The immense white cliffs of the La Cloche Mountains surround you as you ascend through the cascade of huge tumbled boulders of what is known as"The Crack”. Once you reach the top of the ridge, you’ll be treated to beautiful panoramic vistas on all sides – certainly one of the best views in the park! \r\n\r\nNote: Do not try to reach the Crack unless you are in good shape and can get an early start. \r\n\r\nLa Cloche Silhouette Trail 80 km loop (7-10 days) strenuous\r\nAlthough this trail takes up to 10 days to do in its entirety, hikers can take shorter trips starting from two trailheads in George Lake Campground. (Day hikers should leave sufficient time to retrace their steps along the trail back to the campground.) \r\n\r\nThe west section of this trail is moderate, heading to Acid and Lumsden lakes over rolling forested hills. It crosses small streams and rivers, occasionally following the rocky shores of small lakes. Keep on the lookout for wildlife or clues of their presence. \r\n\r\nThe east section of this trail heads uphill to the Crack, a ridge with a vista of rugged and scenic landscapes. Considered strenuous, this section passes through forests and wetlands and over rocky ridges. It takes 12 hours of steady hiking and you have to climb over large boulders to reach the top of the ridge. Do not try to reach the Crack unless you are in good shape and can get an early start. \r\n\r\nHunting \r\n\r\nHunting is prohibited in the vast majority of Killarney Provincial Park. Hunting is permitted in Killarney Lakelands and Headwaters Provincial Park and in Killarney Provincial Park 2006 additions ONLY. Nature reserve zones are excluded. \r\n\r\nWinter Activities \r\n\r\nKillarney Provincial Park has 33km of trail winding through parts of the park only accessible through the winter months. \r\n\r\n\r\n\tChikanishing Trail (Classic and Skate: 8km) - This linear track-set trail meanders along the picturesque Chikanishing Creek. Snow-covered evergreen forests line the trail providing beauty and a peaceful escape from the winds.\r\n\tCollins Inlet Trail (Classic: 14.3km) - This loop trail is packed, but not always track set. As you pass through mature pine forests, open fields and frozen-over marshlands, don’t forget to take a break and enjoy the serenity of this remarkable landscape.\r\n\tFreeland (Classic: 12.4km) - This linear track-set trail winds east through open hardwood and coniferous forest, past Cranberry Bog and onto scenic Freeland Lake.\r\n\r\n\r\nCall ahead for snow and ice conditions or check the Ontario Parks ski report. \r\n\r\nKillarney also offers walk-in winter camping, six heated yurts and two camp cabins. There is a winter warm-up hut located in the day use area with a wood stove for use by both day visitors and winter campers wanting a warm place to sit or eat before crawling into their tents. \r\n\r\nInformation provided by Ontario Parks. \r\n","surface":"","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/killarney-provincial-park-trails\/killarney%20provincial%20park%20trails.png","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/killarney-provincial-park-trails\/killarney%20provincial%20park%20trails.png"},{"id":2357,"trail_name":"Taylor Park Trail Bradford","difficulty_num":1,"character":" Dog Friendly, Natural, Urban","difficulty":1,"activities":"Hiking & Walking, Cycling - Off-Road, Cycling - Roads & Paths, ","nearbyamenities":" Accommodations, Restaurants, Benches, Parking, Trailhead","length":".4 km","closest_town":"Bradford","longitude_num":-79.5640717,"latitude_num":44.1023338,"description":"Location: 400 Walker Avenue \r\n\r\nTrail Length: 392.32 m \r\n\r\nNumber of Access Points: 2 \r\n\r\nDifficulty: Easy \r\n\r\nSurface Type: Paved \r\n\r\nDog Friendly: Yes \r\n\r\nAmenities: Parking, Soccer Pitch, Playground, Taylor Park \r\n\r\nWith information from the Town of Bradford West Gwillimbury \r\n\r\nMap \r\n","surface":"Paved","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/taylor-park-trail-bradford\/Taylor.jpg","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/taylor-park-trail-bradford\/Taylor.jpg"},{"id":2339,"trail_name":"Ottawa River Waterway","difficulty_num":2,"character":" OTC Member, Scenic, Water, Wilderness, Town and Country, Waters","difficulty":2,"activities":"Canoe or Kayak, Backpacking & Camping, ","nearbyamenities":" Accommodations, Restaurants, Benches, Washrooms, Parking, Trailhead","length":"500 km","closest_town":"Petawawa","longitude_num":-77.250321,"latitude_num":45.909851,"description":"There is a neverending supply of water-based adventure in Petawawa - canoe, kayak, SUP and various other water activities. \r\n\r\nCheck out what awaits you on the Petawawa River courtesy of Paddle Tales. \r\n\r\nFormerly known as the Temiskawa waterway, the Ottawa River waterway has something for everyone.

It is still signed to this day, and promoted in newspapers and other media. \r\n\r\nThe Wine Route starts in Windsor, Ontario, and travels down Essex County Road 20, formerly Highway 18, through LaSalle, Ontario and Amherstburg, Ontario. It continues through Harrow, Ontario, before branching off to the ferry docks in Kingsville, Ontario, serving Pelee Island's Pelee Island Winery via a ferry crossing. The trail continues on Pelee Island, and along County Road 20 on the mainland; both meet in Leamington, Ontario at the intersection of Seacliffe Drive and Erie Street, formerly part of Highway 77. \r\n\r\nThe wine route designation continues, unsigned, north to and along Highway 77 to Highway 401. From there it travels east to Highway 403 in Woodstock, Ontario, which it continues along to Hamilton, Ontario and the rest of the Niagara Peninsula. \r\n\r\nThrough the Niagara Region, the route is designated as the Niagara Wine Route, and while well-signed, exists in the form of loops and spurs connecting the various wineries to the communities of the region.[9] The trunk route follows Niagara Regional Road 81, formerly Highway 8 from Grimsby eastward, where in western St. Catharines it diverges into two primary routes. \r\n\r\nThe first route travels north along Regional Road 34, then turns east, following the shore of Lake Ontario along Regional Road 89 and passing through Port Dalhousie and many of the wineries along the lakeshore. The other route passes along the edge of the Niagara Escarpment and through Niagara-on-the-Lake along Regional Roads 69, 100 and 55. A spur along Fourth Avenue and Ontario Street connects wineries in the west-end of the city and Downtown St. Catharines to the northern route, while another spur crosses through central Niagara-on-the-Lake and the community of Virgil, connecting both routes to the Niagara Parkway. The primary routes reconvene in the Olde Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake where Regional Roads 89 and 55 meet, not far from the mouth of the Niagara River. \r\n\r\nA wine route also exists along Highways 33, Highway 62 and Highway 49 in Prince Edward County. \r\n\r\nNewer signs are purely dark blue with white grapes, with the text "Wine Route" written below.[10] These new signs are seen throughout Niagara Region and Prince Edward County. \r\n\r\nWith information from Wikipedia \r\n\r\nOntario Wine Regions \r\n\r\nWine Country Ontario \r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.winetrailride.com \r\n\r\nMap \r\n","surface":"","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/ontario%20tourism%20trails\/ontario%20wine%20route\/ontario%20wine%20route.png","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/ontario%20tourism%20trails\/ontario%20wine%20route\/ontario%20wine%20route.png"},{"id":2361,"trail_name":"Shunia Mines Mountain Bike Trails","difficulty_num":3,"character":" OTC Member, Scenic, Natural, Looped Trail, Wilderness, Forest M","difficulty":3,"activities":"Mountain Biking, Cycling - Off-Road, Winter (Fat) Biking, ","nearbyamenities":" Benches, Parking","length":"41 km","closest_town":"Shuniah","longitude_num":-89.1906557,"latitude_num":48.482936,"description":"MOUNTAIN BIKE IN THUNDER BAY \r\n\r\nThe trails at Shuniah Mines are the most fun you can have on two wheels in the Thunder Bay area. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBy Michelle McChristie \r\n\r\nA freelance writer with a penchant for all things Thunder Bay and Lake Superior. \r\n\r\nUPDATED ON\r\nSEPTEMBER 8, 2017 \r\n\r\n\r\nSafely discover Ontario when the time is right. For the most up-to-date information on where and when it is safe to travel please visit: covid-19.ontario.ca. \r\n\r\nDo your part by following public health advice. It is important to wear a face mask or covering, practice physical distancing, and wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \r\n\r\nThere’s only one word to describe the feeling of cruising through the boreal forest on clean ribbons of singletrack while twisting and turning over the contours of the land: fun. \r\n\r\n\r\nRELATED: \r\n\r\nFat Biking and Hiking at Sleeping Giant Provincial Park \r\n\r\nTo the uninitiated, the idea of biking around an old mine might sound a little odd, if not dangerous. But it’s not that strange for Thunder Bay here in Northwest Ontario, where relics of the mining and forest are commonplace, especially in the bush. It was silver that attracted settlers to Shuniah township, located east of Thunder Bay; the name Shuniah is derived from the Ojibway word zhooniyaa, meaning money or silver. \r\n\r\nThe Shuniah Mines mountain bike trails are built around the Duncan-Shuniah silver mine which operated from 1867 to 1881. The only hints of the area’s history are the fence along the Grand Chasm trail, which keeps people (and their pets) safe away from old shafts, and the quartz along the trail, which attests to the unique geology of the Canadian Shield. \r\n\r\nThe mountain bike trails at Shuniah Mines are the most fun you can have on two wheels in the Thunder Bay area. The network of trails has grown and improved over the years thanks to the efforts of the Blacksheep Mountain Bike Club and the City of Thunder Bay. The trails are impeccably maintained and well-marked, with signage and trail maps located everywhere you need them. \r\n\r\nThere is mixed bag of intermediate to advanced trails that feature smooth singletrack, challenging climbs\/rewarding descents, and some technical singletrack with a-frames, bridges, drops, and a teeter totter. Most of the trails are short (under one kilometre), so plan on riding a few more than once if you want to lengthen your ride. Biking in from The Bluffs, Centennial Park, Cascades Conservation Area, or Kinsmen Park (Trowbridge Falls) will add some mileage and give you a chance to warm up before you hit the singletrack. \r\n\r\nThere are an unlimited variety of routes you can take when you combine the trails in these areas, and the Trailforks App is a handy tool to help navigate. Whatever your route, remember that the Grand Chasm and Doctor’s trails are one-way; all others are two-way. \r\n\r\nHere’s one option for an intermediate rider, starting at Cascades Conservation Area: \r\n\r\nFollow the Blue Trail to Cascades Access 1 which merges with the Adventure Trail. In Shuniah Mines, follow the Hill Top Trail to Road to Hell, then Cassandra, Crossover, Dagobah, and Prologue. Hop back onto the Adventure Trail and take a spin on BMX, then back to the Adventure Trail to connect to Grand Chasm (a must-ride!), then Peekaboo, which spits you back out on the Adventure Trail. Next, follow Doubletrack, Doctor’s, The Stranger, and finally Hilltop back to the Adventure Trail. If you’ve had your fill, return to the Adventure Trail then Cascades Access 1 and, finally, the Blue Trail. \r\n\r\nShuniah & Centennial Park Mountain Bike Trail Stats \r\n\r\nSource: trailforks.com \r\n\r\nTrails: 48 \r\n\r\nTotal Distance: 41 km\r\nTotal Descent Distance: 8 km\r\nTotal Descent: 308 m\r\nHighest Trailhead: 280 m\r\nTotal Vertical: 63 m \r\n\r\nNeed another reason to ride Shuniah?

She is a young girl interested in having a safe place for her dogs to run off leash and socialize with other dogs. Emily also wanted other dog owners to come out and be able to socialize with other dog owners. In the proposal, Emily laid out ideas on how to raise funds, explained the importance for socializing our dog(s) to help make our community a better place. \r\n\r\nThe Municipality has donated 3 acres of land off of Burnside Road for our Park (behind the storage units off of Hill Street). We are planning to have 2 fenced sections to the park for large and small breeds, along with a parking lot. \r\n\r\nIf you are planning on becoming a member of our Park, we ask that your dog(s) are up to date on their shots (rabies). We also advise that you have your dog vaccinated with Kennel Cough in order for our dogs to be able to play safely together. \r\n\r\nHow you can help: \r\n\r\n- Attend our monthly meetings on the 3rd Thursday of every month at the Madoc Arts Centre at 6:30 pm \r\n\r\n- Support us at our fundraisers throughout the community. Like us on FaceBook to find out about our next one \r\n\r\n- Donate items to be used at the park - Garbage bins, picnic tables, benches etc \r\n\r\n- Have your business sponsor the Park and have your sign on our fence to help advertise for you! \r\n\r\nWe look forward to meeting you and your dog(s) at our future fundraising events until the Park is built.

Perimeter fencing is installed but the area is not secure due to gaps under the fence line (as a result of uneven terrain), overland waterflows, and movements of small animals. Owners are advised to choose appropriately for their dog. \r\n\r\nParking \r\n\r\nThe closest parking lot to the area's walk-in entrance is the north arena lot, but alternate parking is available in the south-east parking lot when the north lot is closed for arena events. When possible, the City communicates closure of the north lot via Facebook and Twitter \r\n\r\nSunnidale Park DOLRA\r\n227 Sunnidale Road \r\n\r\nThe Sunnidale Park DOLRA is 7.15 acres of natural, rolling setting with earthen footpaths. The area is NOT wheelchair accessible. The DOLRA is double-gated with 4' high wire mesh fencing. Parking is available at the Dorian Parker Centre, 227 Sunnidale Road, along Sunnidale Road, and on Coulter Street. Upgrades to trails, the addition of two permanent bridges, new benches, and regeneration and restoration of vegetation and soil were completed in 2020. \r\n\r\nCaution: Poison Ivy \r\n\r\nPoison Ivy is a naturally occurring plant in the natural areas in Barrie. It is found in both off-leash areas. Learn to recognize poison ivy and avoid it by staying on existing trails. The City uses herbicides to remove poison ivy and signs are posted to warn residents when spraying occurs. \r\n\r\nUser Guidelines \r\n\r\n\r\n\tThese are not supervised facilities.

This is a group for people who enjoy bringing their Dogs there to play and socialize, want to share fun photos, videos, See whos going, etc... \r\n\r\nWe would like to remind everyone of some simple things... some of us consider this common sense but you would be surprised... these are just things I noticed yesterday during my visit to the dog park. I don't expect everyone to agree with me... but I would hope the majority would. \r\n\r\n1. ALWAYS bring water with you! There were at least 15 people there at one point yesterday and only 4 brought water with them \r\n\r\n2. You MUST pick up your dog's poop and walk it to the garbage cans - dont tie it to the picnic tables or drop it underneath the tables. Someone was confronted yesterday for not picking up after their dog and they replied "Ive picked up after him twice already". If your dog poops 10 times... you need to pick up all 10 poops. No one wants to step in poop - even dogs! \r\n\r\n3. Throw your garbage out - don't leave it on the ground or the table - this area is supposed to be a safe place for our pooches to play - a puppy will grab anything and everything to play with it - this includes sandwich bags, poop bags, timmies cups, granola bar wrappers. \r\n\r\nand lastly \r\n\r\n4. Do not hit or swat at your dog - this type of behavior is unnecessary and should not be tolerated - it creates a hostile environment and can set some dogs off... not to mention some dog owners. \r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/blackwelldogparksarnia\/ \r\n\r\nThis dog park is located in: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tBlackwell Trails Park Connected to the Howard Watson Nature Trail, Blackwell Trails Park is located on Blackwell Road between Modeland and Michigan roads in Sarnia. Covering the completely closed landfill is a 3-kilometer long trail system ideal for non-motorized biking, walking or jogging. Waste Management developed the park in consultation with neighbours adjoining the former landfill. The St. Clair Region Conservation Authority planted 10,000 trees across the site. As these trees mature the paths will find themselves meandering through the treed zones, along with open grassy areas, making for a relaxing stroll with some excellent views. At each end of the park is a re-naturalized wetland, which hosts a variety of waterfowl annually. Waste Management has proudly received certification of the park by the Wildlife Habitat Council. There are six entrances off the Howard Watson Nature Trail and three entrances, with parking, off Blackwell Road. Also on site is a 3.5 acre fully enclosed leash free zone for exercising dogs and a fully accessible playground located at the main entrance.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther resources: \r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.petfriendly.ca\/dog-parks\/dog-park-ontario.php \r\n","surface":"Natural, Paved","masthead_image_1":"","masthead_image":""},{"id":2403,"trail_name":"Fairy Lake Trail","difficulty_num":1,"character":" Dog Friendly, Family Friendly, OTC Member","difficulty":1,"activities":"Hiking & Walking, ","nearbyamenities":" Benches, Washrooms, Parking","length":"1 km","closest_town":"Saugeen Shores","longitude_num":-81.3712871,"latitude_num":44.4945582,"description":"Saugeen Shores is home to over 40 km of trails, nine athletic parks, 27 playgrounds and countless green spaces to enjoy. \r\n\r\nStatus due to COVID-19 \r\n\r\nAll outdoor recreational spaces are open for use, including beaches.

During this dedicated time each month, the trail is closed and cyclists and pedestrians are advised to take an alternate route.  \r\n\r\nScheduled dates for 2022 spring\/summer maintenance are as follows: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tMarch 17, 2022\r\n\tApril 21, 2022\r\n\tMay 19, 2022\r\n\tJune 16, 2022\r\n\tJuly 21, 2022\r\n\tAugust 18, 2022\r\n\tSeptember 15, 2022\r\n\tOctober 20, 2022\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter Maintenance \r\n\r\nSnow on bicycle lanes are generally cleared while the roadways are being cleared. The standard for addressing snow accumulation on bicycle lanes is as follows: \r\n\r\n\r\n\t2.5 cm depth - 8 hour response\r\n\t5 cm depth - 12 hour response\r\n\t8 cm depth - 24 hour response\r\n\t5 - 10 cm depth - 24 hour response.\r\n\r\n\r\nScheduled closure reminders and closures for winter maintenance on the Keddy Access Trail are shared on the City’s Twitter account @CityofHamilton. \r\n\r\nDate modified: \r\n\r\n2021-12-07 09:41 \r\n\r\nRelated Content \r\n\r\n\r\n\tTrails Listing\r\n\tCycling Safety\r\n\tClaremont Access\r\n\r\n","surface":"Paved","masthead_image_1":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/hamilton-cycling-routes\/hamilton%20cycling%20routes%204.png","masthead_image":"\/assets\/images\/trails\/hamilton-cycling-routes\/hamilton%20cycling%20routes%204.png"},{"id":2411,"trail_name":"Chapples Park Trail","difficulty_num":1,"character":" OTC Member, Scenic, Urban, Educational","difficulty":1,"activities":"Hiking & Walking, ","nearbyamenities":" Accommodations, Restaurants, Benches, Washrooms, Parking, Trailhead","length":"2km","closest_town":"Thunder Bay","longitude_num":-89.272734,"latitude_num":48.398921,"description":"Thunder Bay's Active Transportation Plan has one main goal: to help make Thunder Bay a great place to walk, bike, and roll. \r\n\r\nTo do this, we are building cycling lanes, new multi-use trails, active living corridors, and expanding the sidewalk network.

Each major trailhead has secure bike locking stations so you can leave your bike behind and enjoy a walk in nature. \r\n\r\nSafety, Conservation, & Visiting Tips \r\n\r\n\r\n\tCheck the ice status before visiting. Natural Lands staff monitor ice thickness, and post information at the on-site sign at Princess Point (and in the section above) when the ice reaches a safe depth of 10cm\/4”. Unless it is marked safe to do so, stay off the ice.\r\n\tMake note of unsafe areas. Locations of water current have thin ice. This includes creek mouths and next to the Fishway. These areas are indicated on the skating map.\r\n\tStay off the banks. Treated with respect, the marsh is a great place for winter recreation, and a local winter tradition. Treating the area with respect includes staying off the islands and the shoreline banks along the wetland edge. The dry silty banks erode easily, even in winter. Belted Kingfishers and Bank Swallows tunnel into these slopes to nest each summer, but winter visitors can cause the slopes to collapse.\r\n\tLiability. Persons using this area do so at their own risk. The signage is for information purposes only. Royal Botanical Gardens assumes no responsibility for loss of, or damage to property, personal injury or mishap, all activities are at the risk of the participant. Our parking lots are not monitored, please do not leave any valuables in your car.\r\n\tBring a shovel! This is a natural space, and not maintained for perfect skating conditions. Consider the ice surface may be rough, or snow-covered, and plan accordingly.\r\n\tRestricted Recreation. Iceboats\/sailing are prohibited.\r\n\r\n\r\nFood & Drink \r\n\r\nThe Collective Arts Container will be operating on-site at Princess Point with a selection of warm drinks and grab-and-go fare available for purchase.  \r\n\r\nHours \r\n\r\nMonday to Wednesday: 4 to 9 p.m.\r\nThursday: 2 to 9 p.m.\r\nFriday: 12 p.m. to 9 p.m.\r\nSaturday & Saturday: 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. \r\n\r\nPlease note that hours are subject to change. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSupport Conservation at RBG \r\n\r\nThese conservation projects are possible thanks to the generous support of RBG Members and donors.
